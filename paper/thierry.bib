abstract = {During chronic infection, HIV-1 engages in a rapid coevolutionary arms race with the host's adaptive immune system. While it is clear that HIV exerts strong selection on the adaptive immune system, the characteristics of the somatic evolution that shape the immune response are still unknown. Traditional population genetics methods fail to distinguish chronic immune response from healthy repertoire evolution. Here, we infer the evolutionary modes of B-cell repertoires and identify complex dynamics with a constant production of better B-cell receptor (BCR) mutants that compete, maintaining large clonal diversity and potentially slowing down adaptation. A substantial fraction of mutations that rise to high frequencies in pathogen-engaging CDRs of BCRs are beneficial, in contrast to many such changes in structurally relevant frameworks that are deleterious and circulate by hitchhiking. We identify a pattern where BCRs in patients who experience larger viral expansions undergo stronger selection with a rapid turnover of beneficial mutations due to clonal interference in their CDR3 regions. Using population genetics modeling, we show that the extinction of these beneficial mutations can be attributed to the rise of competing beneficial alleles and clonal interference. The picture is of a dynamic repertoire, where better clones may be outcompeted by new mutants before they fix.},

abstract = {T cells are produced through 2 mechanisms, thymopoiesis and proliferative expansion of postthymic T cells. Thymic output generates diversity of the pool, and proliferation achieves optimal clonal size of each individual T cell. To determine the contribution of these 2 mechanisms to the formation of the initial T-cell repertoire, we examined neonates of 30 to 40 weeks' gestation. Peripheral T cells were in a state of high proliferative turnover. In premature infants, 10{\%} of T cells were dividing; the proliferation rates then declined but were still elevated in mature newborns. Throughout the third trimester, concentrations of T-cell-receptor excision circles (TRECs) were 10 per 100 T cells. Stability of TREC frequencies throughout the period of repertoire generation suggested strict regulation of clonal size to approximately 10 to 20 cells. Neonatal naive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were explicitly responsive to IL-7; growth-promoting properties of IL-15 were selective for newborn CD8+ T cells. Neonatal T cells expressed telomerase and, in spite of the high turnover, built up a telomeric reserve. Thus, proliferative expansion, facilitated by increased cytokine responsiveness, and thymopoiesis complement each other as mechanisms of T-cell production in neonates. Maintaining optimal clonal size instead of filling the space in a lymphopenic host appears to regulate homeostatic T-cell proliferation during fetal development.},

abstract = {The diversity of an organism's B-and T-cell repertoires is both clinically important and a key measure of immunological complexity. However, diversity is hard to estimate by current methods, because of inherent uncertainty in the number of B-and T-cell clones that will be missing from a blood or tissue sample by chance (the missing-species problem), inevitable sampling bias, and experimental noise. To solve this problem, we developed Recon, a modified maximum-likelihood method that outputs the overall diversity of a repertoire from measurements on a sample. Recon outputs accurate, robust estimates by any of a vast set of complementary diversity measures, including species richness and entropy, at fractional repertoire coverage. It also outputs error bars and power tables, allowing robust comparisons of diversity between individuals and over time. We apply Recon to in silico and experimental immune-repertoire sequencing data sets as proof of principle for measuring diversity in large, complex systems.},

abstract = {An adaptive agent predicting the future state of an environment must weigh trust in new observations against prior experiences. In this light, we propose a view of the adaptive immune system as a dynamic Bayesian machinery that updates its memory repertoire by balancing evidence from new pathogen encounters against past experience of infection to predict and prepare for future threats. This framework links the observed initial rapid increase of the memory pool early in life followed by a midlife plateau to the ease of learning salient features of sparse environments. We also derive a modulated memory pool update rule in agreement with current vaccine-response experiments. Our results suggest that pathogenic environments are sparse and that memory repertoires significantly decrease infection costs, even with moderate sampling. The predicted optimal update scheme maps onto commonly considered competitive dynamics for antigen receptors.},

abstract = {T-cell receptor (TCR) diversity, a prerequisite for immune system recognition of the universe of foreign antigens, is generated in the first two decades of life in the thymus and then persists to an unknown extent through life via homeostatic proliferation of na{\"{i}}ve T cells. We have used next-generation sequencing and nonparametric statistical analysis to estimate a lower bound for the total number of different TCR beta (TCRB) sequences in human repertoires. We arrived at surprisingly high minimal estimates of 100 million unique TCRB sequences in na{\"{i}}ve CD4 and CD8 T-cell repertoires of young adults. Na{\"{i}}ve repertoire richness modestly declined two- to fivefold in healthy elderly. Repertoire richness contraction with age was even less pronounced for memory CD4 and CD8 T cells. In contrast, age had a major impact on the inequality of clonal sizes, as estimated by a modified Gini-Simpson index clonality score. In particular, large na{\"{i}}ve T-cell clones that were distinct from memory clones were found in the repertoires of elderly individuals, indicating uneven homeostatic proliferation without development of a memory cell phenotype. Our results suggest that a highly diverse repertoire is maintained despite thymic involution; however, peripheral fitness selection of T cells leads to repertoire perturbations that can influence the immune response in the elderly.},

abstract = {Molecular phenotypes are important links between genomic information and organismic functions, fitness, and evolution. Complex phenotypes, which are also called quantitative traits, often depend on multiple genomic loci. Their evolution builds on genome evolution in a complicated way, which involves selection, genetic drift, mutations and recombination. Here we develop a coarse-grained evolutionary statistics for phenotypes, which decouples from details of the underlying genotypes. We derive approximate evolution equations for the distribution of phenotype values within and across populations. This dynamics covers evolutionary processes at high and low recombination rates, that is, it applies to sexual and asexual populations. In a fitness landscape with a single optimal phenotype value, the phenotypic diversity within populations and the divergence between populations reach evolutionary equilibria, which describe stabilizing selection. We compute the equilibrium distributions of both quantities analytically and we show that the ratio of mean divergence and diversity depends on the strength of selection in a universal way: it is largely independent of the phenotype's genomic encoding and of the recombination rate. This establishes a new method for the inference of selection on molecular phenotypes beyond the genome level. We discuss the implications of our findings for the predictability of evolutionary processes.},

Challenges that staff members experienced when working with IS included university and student-level challenges lack of incentive, heavy workloads, and perceived language barriers. A main issue related to equity and whether or not staff members were acting in an equitable manner towards the IS and DS. Themes that emerged included lack of training for staff members responsible for working with ESL students and miscommunication between staff members. These issues added onto an already heavy workload which was felt as even heavier because of IS perceived language barriers. For many academic staff members, these factors appear to have contributed to the reported increase in leniency-whereby lectures evaluate academic work from IS differently to those of DS. The implications of these findings for institutions which enroll IS are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {The adaptive immune system uses several strategies to generate a repertoire of T- and B-cell antigen receptors with sufficient diversity to recognize the universe of potential pathogens. In alphabeta T cells, which primarily recognize peptide antigens presented by major histocompatibility complex molecules, most of this receptor diversity is contained within the third complementarity-determining region (CDR3) of the T-cell receptor (TCR) alpha and beta chains. Although it has been estimated that the adaptive immune system can generate up to 10(16) distinct alphabeta pairs, direct assessment of TCR CDR3 diversity has not proved amenable to standard capillary electrophoresis-based DNA sequencing. We developed a novel experimental and computational approach to measure TCR CDR3 diversity based on single-molecule DNA sequencing, and used this approach to determine the CDR3 sequence in millions of rearranged TCRbeta genes from T cells of 2 adults. We find that total TCRbeta receptor diversity is at least 4-fold higher than previous estimates, and the diversity in the subset of CD45RO(+) antigen-experienced alphabeta T cells is at least 10-fold higher than previous estimates. These methods should prove valuable for assessment of alphabeta T-cell repertoire diversity after hematopoietic cell transplantation, in states of congenital or acquired immunodeficiency, and during normal aging.},

Antibodies that protect against highly mutable pathogens must neutralize diverse strains. Developing effective immunization strategies to drive their evolution requires understanding how affinity maturation happens in an environment where variants of the same antigen are present. We present an in silico model of affinity maturation driven by antigen variants which reveals that induction of cross-reactive antibodies often occurs with low probability because conflicting selection forces, imposed by different antigen variants, can frustrate affinity maturation. We describe how variables such as temporal pattern of antigen administration influence the outcome of this frustrated evolutionary process. Our calculations predict, and experiments in mice with variant gp120 constructs of the HIV envelope protein confirm, that sequential immunization with antigen variants is preferred over a cocktail for induction of cross-reactive antibodies focused on the shared CD4 binding site epitope.},

abstract = {Self-renewal is generally thought to play a major role in the maintenance of the T-cell repertoire. Here we develop a set of mathematical models for T-cell activation by peptides on antigen presenting cells (APCs). We show that competition between T cells is inherent to the processes involved in T cells binding APCs. We prove that for each dominant peptide only one T-cell clone can ultimately survive the competition. This is analogous to a classical result from theoretical ecology known as the principle of ‘competitive exclusion'. These findings allow for three main results. First, competitive exclusion during an immune response to antigen implies that the clone(s) with the highest affinity for-the dominant peptide(s) will outcompete all others. This allows for a form of ‘affinity selection'. Second, the competition for binding-antigen gives rise to regulation of T-cell numbers within a single clone. This allows for a regulated form of T-cell memory when T cells are continuously activated by a persisting antigen. Third, competitive exclusion implies that for each peptide only one T-cell specificity can be maintained in the repertoire. If the T-cell repertoire is largely maintained owing to cross-reactivities with various antigens, competitive exclusion means that the diversity of the T-cell repertoire is limited by the number of antigens stimulating the system. If the cross-reactivities were to involve activation by self antigens this would confirm an earlier result suggesting that the T-cell repertoire is diverse owing to the diversity of the self environment. {\textcopyright} 1994 Academic Press Limited.},

abstract = {Adaptive T-cell immunity relies on the recruitment of antigen-specific clonotypes, each defined by the expression of a distinct T-cell receptor (TCR), from an array of na{\{}{\"{i}}{\}}ve T-cell precursors. Despite the enormous clonotypic diversity that resides within the na{\{}{\"{i}}{\}}ve T-cell pool, interindividual sharing of TCR sequences has been observed within mobilized T-cell responses specific for certain peptide-major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) antigens. The mechanisms that underlie this phenomenon have not been fully elucidated, however. A mechanism of convergent recombination has been proposed to account for the occurrence of shared, or "public," TCRs in specific memory T-cell populations. According to this model, TCR sharing between individuals is directly related to TCR production frequency; this, in turn, is determined on a probabilistic basis by the relative generation efficiency of particular nucleotide and amino acid sequences during the recombination process. Here, we tested the key predictions of convergent recombination in a comprehensive evaluation of the na{\{}{\"{i}}{\}}ve CD8(+) TCR$\beta$ repertoire in mice. Within defined segments of the na{\{}{\"{i}}{\}}ve CD8(+) T-cell repertoire, TCR$\beta$ sequences with convergent features were (i) present at higher copy numbers within individual mice and (ii) shared between individual mice. Thus, the na{\{}{\"{i}}{\}}ve CD8(+) T-cell repertoire is not flat, but comprises a hierarchy of recurrence rates for individual clonotypes that is determined by relative production frequencies. These findings provide a framework for understanding the early mobilization of public CD8(+) T-cell clonotypes, which can exert profound biological effects during acute infectious processes.},

A method is presented to test the precision, accuracy, and sensitivity of this assay. T cell clones, each with one fixed productive TCR rearrangement, are doped into complex blood cell samples. TCRs from a total of eleven samples are sequenced, with the doped T cell clones ranging from 10{\%} of the total sample to 0.001{\%} (one cell in 100,000). The assay is able to detect even the rarest clones. The precision of the assay is demonstrated across five orders of magnitude.

abstract = {Although immunotherapeutic strategies are emerging as adjunctive treatments for cancer, sensitive methods of monitoring the immune response after treatment remain to be established. We used a novel next-generation sequencing approach to determine whether quantitative assessments of tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) content and the degree of overlap of T-cell receptor (TCR) sequences in brain tumors and peripheral blood were predictors of immune response and overall survival in glioblastoma patients treated with autologous tumor lysate-pulsed dendritic cell immunotherapy. A statistically significant correlation was found between a higher estimated TIL content and increased time to progression and overall survival. In addition, we were able to assess the proportion of shared TCR sequences between tumor and peripheral blood at time points before and after therapy, and found the level of TCR overlap to correlate with survival outcomes. Higher degrees of overlap, or the development of an increased overlap following immunotherapy, was correlated with improved clinical outcome, and may provide insights into the successful, antigen-specific immune response.

abstract = {Consider a stochastic abundance model in which the species arrive in the sample according to independent Poisson processes, where the abundance parameters of the processes follow a gamma distribution. We propose a new estimator of the number of species for this model. The estimator takes the form of the number of duplicated species (i.e., species represented by two or more individuals) divided by an estimated duplication fraction. The duplication fraction is estimated from all frequencies including singleton information. The new estimator is closely related to the sample coverage estimator presented by Chao and Lee (1992, Journal of the American Statistical Association 87, 210-217). We illustrate the procedure using the Malayan butterfly data discussed by Fisher, Corbet, and Williams (1943, Journal of Animal Ecology 12, 42-58) and a 1989 Christmas Bird Count dataset collected in Florida, U.S.A. Simulation studies show that this estimator compares well with maximum likelihood estimators (i.e., empirical Bayes estimators from the Bayesian viewpoint) for which an iterative numerical procedure is needed and may be infeasible.},

Here, we applied HTS to the diagnosis of T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma. Using 43 paired patient samples, we then assessed minimal residual disease (MRD) at day 29 after treatment. The variable regions of TCRB and TCRG were sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq platform after performance of multiplexed polymerase chain reaction, which targeted all potential V-J rearrangement combinations. Pretreatment samples were used to define clonal T cell receptor (TCR) complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) sequences, and paired posttreatment samples were evaluated for MRD. Abnormal T lymphoblast identification by multiparametric flow cytometry was concurrently performed for comparison. We found that TCRB and TCRG HTS not only identified clonality at diagnosis in most cases (31 of 43 for TCRB and 27 of 43 for TCRG) but also detected subsequent MRD. As expected, HTS of TCRB and TCRG identified MRD that was not detected by flow cytometry in a subset of cases (25 of 35 HTS compared with 13 of 35, respectively), which highlights the potential of this technology to define lower detection thresholds for MRD that could affect clinical treatment decisions. Thus, next-generation sequencing of lymphoid receptor gene repertoire may improve clinical diagnosis and subsequent MRD monitoring of lymphoproliferative disorders.},

abstract = {The diversity of the immune repertoire is initially generated by random rearrangements of the receptor gene during early T and B cell development. Rearrangement scenarios are composed of random events -- choices of gene templates, base pair deletions and insertions -- described by probability distributions. Not all scenarios are equally likely, and the same receptor sequence may be obtained in several different ways. Quantifying the distribution of these rearrangements is an essential baseline for studying the immune system diversity. Inferring the properties of the distributions from receptor sequences is a computationally hard problem, requiring enumerating every possible scenario for every sampled receptor sequence. We present a Hidden Markov model, which accounts for all plausible scenarios that can generate the receptor sequences. We developed and implemented a method based on the Baum-Welch algorithm that can efficiently infer the parameters for the different events of the rearrangement process. We tested our software tool on sequence data for both the alpha and beta chains of the T cell receptor. To test the validity of our algorithm, we also generated synthetic sequences produced by a known model, and confirmed that its parameters could be accurately inferred back from the sequences. The inferred model can be used to generate synthetic sequences, to calculate the probability of generation of any receptor sequence, as well as the theoretical diversity of the repertoire. We estimate this diversity to be {\$}\backslashapprox 10{\^{}}{\{}23{\}}{\$} for human T cells. The model gives a baseline to investigate the selection and dynamics of immune repertoires.},

abstract = {The T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire is formed by random recombinations of genomic precursor elements; the resulting combinatorial diversity renders unlikely extensive TCR sharing between individuals. Here, we studied CDR3$\beta$ amino acid sequence sharing in a repertoire-wide manner, using high-throughput TCR-seq in 28 healthy mice. We uncovered hundreds of public sequences shared by most mice. Public CDR3 sequences, relative to private sequences, are two orders of magnitude more abundant on average, express restricted V/J segments, and feature high convergent nucleic acid recombination. Functionally, public sequences are enriched for MHC-diverse CDR3 sequences that were previously associated with autoimmune, allograft, and tumor-related reactions, but not with anti-pathogen-related reactions. Public CDR3 sequences are shared between mice of different MHC haplotypes, but are associated with different, MHC-dependent, V genes. Thus, despite their random generation process, TCR repertoires express a degree of uniformity in their post-genomic organization. These results, together with numerical simulations of TCR genomic rearrangements, suggest that biases and convergence in TCR recombination combine with ongoing selection to generate a restricted subset of self-associated, public CDR3 TCR sequences, and invite reexamination of the basic mechanisms of T-cell repertoire formation.},

We developed a statistical classification framework that could diagnose CMV status from the resulting catalog of TCR$\beta$ sequences with high specificity and sensitivity in both the original cohort and a validation cohort of 120 different subjects. We also confirmed that three of the identified CMV-associated TCR$\beta$ molecules bind CMV in vitro, and, moreover, we used this approach to accurately predict the HLA-A and HLA-B alleles of most subjects in the first cohort. As all memory T cell responses are encoded in the common format of somatic TCR recombination, our approach could potentially be generalized to a wide variety of disease states, as well as other immunological phenotypes, as a highly parallelizable diagnostic strategy.},

Often, there are several rearrangements that are nearly equivalent as candidates for a given Ig gene, but have different consequences in an analysis. Our aim in this article is to develop a probabilistic model of the rearrangement process and a Bayesian method for estimating posterior probabilities for the comparison of multiple plausible rearrangements.

RESULTS: We have developed SoDA2, which is based on a Hidden Markov Model and used to compute the posterior probabilities of candidate rearrangements and to find those with the highest values among them. We validated the software on a set of simulated data, a set of clonally related sequences, and a group of randomly selected Ig heavy chains from Genbank. In most tests, SoDA2 performed better than other available software for the task. Furthermore, the output format has been redesigned, in part, to facilitate comparison of multiple solutions.

abstract = {We have analyzed a large collection of coding junctions generated in human cells. From this analysis, we infer the following about nucleotide processing at coding joints in human cells. First, the pattern of nucleotide loss from coding ends is influenced by the base composition of the coding end sequences. AT-rich sequences suffer greater loss than do GC-rich sequences. Second, inverted repeats can occur at ends that have undergone nucleolytic processing. Previously, inverted repeats (P nucleotides) have been noted only at coding ends that have not undergone nucleolytic processing, this observation being the basis for a model in which a hairpin intermediate is formed at the coding ends early in the reaction. Here, inverted repeats at processed coding ends were present at approximately twice the number of junctions as P nucleotide additions. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) is required for the appearance of the inverted repeats at processed ends (but not full-length coding ends), yet statistical analysis shows that it is virtually impossible for the inverted repeats to be polymerized by TdT. Third, TdT additions are not random. It has long been noted that TdT has a G utilization preference. In addition to the G preference, we find that TdT adds strings of purines or strings of pyrimidines at a highly significant frequency. This tendency suggests that nucleotide-stacking interactions affect TdT polymerization. All three of these features place constraints on the extent of junctional diversity in human V(D)J recombination.},

These models are based solely on pairwise correlations between residue positions but correctly capture the higher order statistical properties of the repertoire. By exploiting the interpretation of these models as statistical physics problems, we make several predictions for the collective properties of the sequence ensemble: The distribution of sequences obeys Zipf's law, the repertoire decomposes into several clusters, and there is a massive restriction of diversity because of the correlations. These predictions are completely inconsistent with models in which amino acid substitutions are made independently at each site and are in good agreement with the data. Our results suggest that antibody diversity is not limited by the sequences encoded in the genome and may reflect rapid adaptation to antigenic challenges.

We reveal that substantial information about T-cell lineage is encoded by V$\alpha$$\beta$ gene pairs and, to a lesser extent, by several other TCR features such as CDR3 length and charge. We further find that the strength of association between the $\beta$ chain and T-cell lineage is surprisingly weak, similar in strength to that of the $\alpha$ chain. Using machine learning classifiers to predict T-cell lineage from TCR features, we demonstrate that $\alpha$$\beta$ chain pairs are significantly more informative than individual chains alone.

The enormous T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire, which is required for recognising foreign and self-antigens2, could serve as lineage tags to track these T cells in tumours3. Here, we obtained transcriptomes of 11,138 single T cells from 12 patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) and developed STARTRAC (single T-cell analysis by RNA-seq and TCR tracking) indices to quantitatively analyse dynamic relationships among 20 identified T cell subsets with distinct functions and clonalities. While both CD8+ effector and “exhausted” T cells exhibited high clonal expansion, they were independently connected with tumour-resident CD8+ effector memory cells, implicating a TCR-based fate decision. Of the CD4+ T cells, the majority of tumour-infiltrating Tregs showed clonal exclusivity, whereas certain Treg clones were developmentally linked to multiple TH clones. Notably, we identified two IFNG+ TH1-like clusters in tumours, the GZMK+ TEM and CXCL13+BHLHE40+ TH1-like clusters, which were associated with distinct IFN-$\gamma$-regulating transcription factors, EOMES/RUNX3 and BHLHE40, respectively. Only CXCL13+BHLHE40+ TH1-like cells were preferentially enriched in tumours of microsatellite-instable (MSI) patients, which might explain their favourable responses to immune-checkpoint blockade. Furthermore, IGFLR1 was highly expressed in both CXCL13+BHLHE40+ TH1-like and CD8+ exhausted T cells and possessed co-stimulatory functions. Our integrated STARTRAC analyses provide a powerful avenue to comprehensively dissect the T cell properties in CRC, which could provide new insights into the dynamic relationships of T cells in other cancers.},

abstract = {Therapies that target the programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor have shown unprecedented rates of durable clinical responses in patients with various cancer types. One mechanism by which cancer tissues limit the host immune response is via upregulation of PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) and its ligation to PD-1 on antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells (termed adaptive immune resistance). Here we show that pre-existing CD8(+) T cells distinctly located at the invasive tumour margin are associated with expression of the PD-1/PD-L1 immune inhibitory axis and may predict response to therapy. We analysed samples from 46 patients with metastatic melanoma obtained before and during anti-PD-1 therapy (pembrolizumab) using quantitative immunohistochemistry, quantitative multiplex immunofluorescence, and next-generation sequencing for T-cell antigen receptors (TCRs). In serially sampled tumours, patients responding to treatment showed proliferation of intratumoral CD8(+) T cells that directly correlated with radiographic reduction in tumour size. Pre-treatment samples obtained from responding patients showed higher numbers of CD8-, PD-1- and PD-L1-expressing cells at the invasive tumour margin and inside tumours, with close proximity between PD-1 and PD-L1, and a more clonal TCR repertoire. Using multivariate analysis, we established a predictive model based on CD8 expression at the invasive margin and validated the model in an independent cohort of 15 patients. Our findings indicate that tumour regression after therapeutic PD-1 blockade requires pre-existing CD8(+) T cells that are negatively regulated by PD-1/PD-L1-mediated adaptive immune resistance.},

Transmitting information through complex signaling networks with redundancies can overcome this limitation. We developed an integrative theoretical and experimental framework, based on the formalism of information theory, to quantitatively predict and measure the amount of information transduced by molecular and cellular networks. Analyzing tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling revealed that individual TNF signaling pathways transduce information sufficient for accurate binary decisions, and an upstream bottleneck limits the information gained via multiple integrated pathways. Negative feedback to this bottleneck could both alleviate and enhance its limiting effect, despite decreasing noise.

Among the major MHC class I loci, HLA-B is the swiftest evolving and the most polymorphic locus. Additionally, responses restricted by HLA-B molecules tend to be dominant, and most associations with susceptibility or protection against infectious diseases have been assigned to HLA-B alleles. To assess whether the differences in responses mediated via two major HLA class I loci, HLA-B and HLA-A, may already begin at the Ag presentation level, we have analyzed the diversity and binding affinity of their peptide repertoire by making use of curated pathogen-derived epitope data retrieved from the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource, as well as in silico predicted epitopes. In contrast to our expectations, HLA-B alleles were found to have a less diverse peptide repertoire, which points toward a more restricted binding motif, and the respective average peptide binding affinity was shown to be lower than that of HLA-A-restricted epitopes. This unexpected observation gives rise to new hypotheses concerning the mechanisms underlying immunodominance of CD8(+) T cell responses.},

abstract = {A detailed characterization of the dynamics and breadth of the immune response to an acute viral infection, as well as the determinants of recruitment to immunological memory, can greatly contribute to our basic understanding of the mechanics of the human immune system, and can ultimately guide the design of effective vaccines. In addition to neutralizing antibodies, T cells have been shown to be critical for the effective resolution of acute viral infections. We report the first in-depth analysis of the dynamics of the CD8(+) T cell repertoire at the level of individual T cell clonal lineages upon vaccination of human volunteers with a single dose of YF-17D. This live attenuated yellow fever vaccine yields sterile, long-term immunity and has been previously used as a model to understand the immune response to a controlled acute viral infection. We identified and enumerated unique CD8(+) T cell clones specifically induced by this vaccine through a combined experimental and statistical approach that includes high throughput sequencing of the CDR3 variable region of the T cell receptor $\beta$ chain and an algorithm that detects significantly expanded T cell clones. This allowed us to establish that: (a) on average ∼2,000 CD8(+) T cell clones were induced by YF-17D, (b) 5-6{\%} of the responding clones were recruited to long-term memory three months post-vaccination, (c) the most highly-expanded effector clones were preferentially recruited to the memory compartment, and (d) a fraction of the YF-17D-induced clones can be identified from peripheral blood lymphocytes solely by measuring clonal expansion.

IMPORTANCE: The exhaustive investigation of pathogen-induced effector T cells is essential to accurately quantify the dynamics of the human immune response. The yellow fever vaccine (YFV) has been broadly used as a model to understand how a controlled, self-resolving acute viral infection induces an effective and long-term protective immune response. Here, we extend this previous work by reporting the identity of activated effector T cell clones that expand in response to the YFV two weeks post-vaccination (as defined by their unique T-cell receptor gene sequence), and by tracking clones that enter the memory compartment 6 weeks later. This is the first study to use high-throughput sequencing of immune cells to characterize the breadth of the anti-viral effector cell response, and to determine the contribution of unique virus-induced clones to the long-lived memory T cell repertoire. Thus, it establishes a benchmark against which future vaccines can be compared to predict their efficacy.},

Yet, viruses that cause chronic infections, such as HIV, can survive by evolving as quickly as the adaptive immune system, forming an evolutionary arms race within a host. Here we introduce a mathematical framework to study the co-evolutionary dynamics of antibodies with antigens within a patient. We focus on changes in the binding interactions between the antibody and antigen populations, which result from the underlying stochastic evolution of genotype frequencies driven by mutation, selection, and drift. We identify the critical viral and immune parameters that determine the distribution of antibody-antigen binding affinities. We also identify definitive signatures of co-evolution that measure the reciprocal response between the antibody and viruses, and we introduce experimentally measurable quantities that quantify the extent of adaptation during continual co-evolution of the two opposing populations. Finally, we analyze competition between clonal lineages of antibodies and characterize the fate of a given lineage dependent on the state of the antibody and viral populations. In particular, we derive the conditions that favor the emergence of broadly neutralizing antibodies, which may be used in designing a vaccine against HIV.},

abstract = {Quantifying diversity is of central importance for the study of structure, function and evolution of microbial communities. The estimation of microbial diversity has received renewed attention with the advent of large-scale metagenomic studies. Here, we consider what the diversity observed in a sample tells us about the diversity of the community being sampled. First, we argue that one cannot reliably estimate the absolute and relative number of microbial species present in a community without making unsupported assumptions about species abundance distributions. The reason for this is that sample data do not contain information about the number of rare species in the tail of species abundance distributions. We illustrate the difficulty in comparing species richness estimates by applying Chao's estimator of species richness to a set of in silico communities: they are ranked incorrectly in the presence of large numbers of rare species. Next, we extend our analysis to a general family of diversity metrics (‘Hill diversities'), and construct lower and upper estimates of diversity values consistent with the sample data. The theory generalizes Chao's estimator, which we retrieve as the lower estimate of species richness. We show that Shannon and Simpson diversity can be robustly estimated for the in silico communities. We analyze nine metagenomic data sets from a wide range of environments, and show that our findings are relevant for empirically-sampled communities. Hence, we recommend the use of Shannon and Simpson diversity rather than species richness in efforts to quantify and compare microbial diversity.},

High-throughput TCR sequencing (TCR-seq) involves the use of next generation sequencing platforms to generate large numbers of short DNA sequences covering key regions of the TCR coding sequence, which enables quantification of T-cell diversity at unprecedented resolution. TCR-seq studies have provided new insights into the healthy human T-cell repertoire, such as revised estimates of repertoire size and the understanding that TCR specificities are shared among individuals more frequently than previously anticipated. In the context of disease, TCR-seq has been instrumental in characterizing the recovery of the immune repertoire after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and the method has been used to develop biomarkers and diagnostics for various infectious and neoplastic diseases. However, T-cell repertoire sequencing is still in its infancy. It is expected that maturation of the field will involve the introduction of improved, standardized tools for data handling, deposition and statistical analysis, as well as the emergence of new and equivalently large-scale technologies for T-cell functional analysis and antigen discovery.

abstract = {The genetic diversity of a species is shaped by its recent evolutionary history and can be used to infer demographic events or selective sweeps. Most inference methods are based on the null hypothesis that natural selection is a weak or infrequent evolutionary force. However, many species, particularly pathogens, are under continuous pressure to adapt in response to changing environments. A statistical framework for inference from diversity data of such populations is currently lacking. Toward this goal, we explore the properties of genealogies in a model of continual adaptation in asexual populations. We show that lineages trace back to a small pool of highly fit ancestors, in which almost simultaneous coalescence of more than two lineages frequently occurs. While such multiple mergers are unlikely under the neutral coalescent, they create a unique genetic footprint in adapting populations. The site frequency spectrum of derived neutral alleles, for example, is non-monotonic and has a peak at high frequencies, whereas Tajima's D becomes more and more negative with increasing sample size. Since multiple merger coalescents emerge in many models of rapid adaptation, we argue that they should be considered as a null-model for adapting populations.},

abstract = {During fetal life, both Ig and TCR-gamma delta repertoires are enriched for a specific set of Ag receptors with limited diversity. In order to test the hypothesis that diversification of the human TCR-beta repertoire also follows a developmental program, we examined TCR-beta DJ and VDJ transcripts from fetal and adult thymi. A consistent bias for D beta 1.1 and J beta 1.1 was present in DJ transcripts amplified from 8-wk gestation thymi. Although it is possible to splice and translate D beta 1.1 in all three reading frames, 8-wk gestation fetal DJ transcripts were enriched for D beta 1.1 spliced to J beta 1.1 in reading frame one. Preference for D beta 1.1 reading frame one and for use of J beta 1.1 dwindled with increasing gestational age. Reading frame bias was not affected by the insertion of non-germ-line-encoded nucleotides (N regions) or by the site of gene splicing. In contrast, choice of reading frame and use of J beta 1.1 appeared random in VDJ transcripts from the same 8-wk gestation and adult thymic samples. Among the occasional VDJ transcripts that contained D beta 1.1-J beta 1.1 rearrangements, use of D beta reading frame one was rare. Up to 75{\%} of DJ and VDJ transcripts at 8-wk gestation lacked N regions. Both the percentage of DJ and VDJ transcripts with N regions and the average number of inserted nucleotides per transcript increased with gestational age. Primarily as a result of enhanced N region addition, both the length and sequence diversity of the VDJ junctions increased markedly from 8-wk gestation to adult life with a concomitant increase in the potential size of the TCR-alpha beta repertoire. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase (TdT), the enzyme associated with N region addition, has not been detected in thymus before 19 wk of gestation. However, we were able to amplify TdT mRNA from all fetal thymi examined. This suggests that TdT may be expressed as early as 8 wk gestation, although at low levels. The early fetal thymus appears enriched for a population of thymocytes that produce minimal quantities of TdT, express a special set of TCR-beta DJ transcripts, and generate a TCR-beta repertoire with limited diversity. These findings support the hypothesis that limitations in the diversity of the TCR repertoire imposed at the time of gene rearrangement contribute to the immaturity of the fetal immune response.},

Three of the TIL TCRs were specific for non-mutated self-antigens, two of which were present in separate patient tumors, and shared specificity for a non-mutated self-antigen derived from U2AF2. These results show that the exposed recognition surface of MHC-bound peptides accessible to the TCR contains sufficient structural information to enable the reconstruction of sequences of peptide targets for pathogenic TCRs of unknown specificity. This finding underscores the surprising specificity of TCRs for their cognate antigens and enables the facile indentification of tumor antigens through unbiased screening. A new approach for identifying T cell receptor ligands reveals insights into the specificity of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes.},

The proliferation and degradation dynamics of different cell types (B cells, T cells, naive, memory) is governed by a variety of antigenic and environmental signals, yet the observed clone sizes follow a universal power-law distribution. Guided by this reproducibility we propose effective models of somatic evolution where cell fate depends on an effective fitness. This fitness is determined by growth factors acting either on clones of cells with the same receptor responding to specific antigens, or directly on single cells with no regard for clones. We identify fluctuations in the fitness acting specifically on clones as the essential ingredient leading to the observed distributions. Combining our models with experiments, we characterize the scale of fluctuations in antigenic environments and we provide tools to identify the relevant growth signals in different tissues and organisms. Our results generalize to any evolving population in a fluctuating environment.},

abstract = {Motivation: High-throughput sequencing of large immune repertoires has enabled the de- velopment of methods to predict the probability of generation by V(D)J recombination of T- and B-cell receptors of any specific nucleotide sequence. These generation probabilities are very non-homogeneous, ranging over 20 orders of magnitude in real repertoires. Since the function of a receptor really depends on its protein sequence, it is important to be able to predict this probability of generation at the amino acid level. However, brute-force summation over all the nucleotide sequences with the correct amino acid translation is computationally intractable. The purpose of this paper is to present a solution to this problem. Results: We use dynamic programming to construct an efficient and flexible algorithm, called OLGA (Optimized Likelihood estimate of immunoGlobulin Amino-acid sequences), for calculating the probability of generating a given CDR3 amino acid sequence or motif, with or without V/J restriction, as a result of V(D)J recombination in B or T cells. We apply it to databases of epitope-specific T-cell receptors to evaluate the probability that a typical human subject will possess T cells responsive to specific disease-associated epitopes. The model prediction shows an excellent agreement with published data. We suggest that OLGA may be a useful tool to guide vaccine design.

abstract = {The development of mature, antigen-inexperienced (naive) T cells begins in the thymus and continues after export into the periphery. Post-thymic maturation of naive T cells, in humans, coincides with the progressive loss of markers such as protein tyrosine kinase 7 (PTK7) and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (CD31). As a consequence, subpopulations of naive T cells can be recognised raising questions about the processes that give rise to the loss of these markers and their exact relationship to recent thymic emigrants (RTE). Here, we combine a mathematical survival analysis approach and data from healthy and thymectomised humans to understand the apparent persistence of populations of 'veteran' PTK7 (+) T cells in thymectomised individuals. We show that a model of heterogeneity in rates of maturation, possibly linked to natural variation in TCR signalling thresholds or affinity for self-antigens, can explain the data. This model of maturation predicts that the average post-thymic age of PTK7 (+) T cells will increase linearly with the age of the host suggesting that, despite the immature phenotype, PTK7 (+) cells do not necessarily represent a population of RTE. Further, the model predicts an accelerated increase in the average post-thymic age of residual PTK7 (+) T cells following thymectomy and may also explain in part the prematurely aged phenotype of the naive T cell pool in individuals thymectomised early in life.},

In inverse problems, the usual procedure of statistical physics needs to be reversed: Instead of calculating observables on the basis of model parameters, we seek to infer parameters of a model based on observations. In this review, we focus on the inverse Ising problem and closely related problems, namely how to infer the coupling strengths between spins given observed spin correlations, magnetisations, or other data. We review applications of the inverse Ising problem, including the reconstruction of neural connections, protein structure determination, and the inference of gene regulatory networks. For the inverse Ising problem in equilibrium, a number of controlled and uncontrolled approximate solutions have been developed in the statistical mechanics community. A particularly strong method, pseudolikelihood, stems from statistics. We also review the inverse Ising problem in the non-equilibrium case, where the model parameters must be reconstructed based on non-equilibrium statistics.},

abstract = {Somatic hypermutation introduces mutations into IgV genes during affinity maturation of the {\{}B{\}} cell response. Mutations are introduced nonrandomly, and are generally targeted to the complementarity determining regions (CDRs). Subsequent selection against mutations that result in lower affinity or nonfunctional Ig increases the relative number of mutations in the CDRs. Investigation of somatic hypermutation is hampered by the effects of selection. We have avoided this by studying out-of-frame human IgVH4.21 and 251 genes, which, being unused alleles, are unselected. By comparison of the frequency of A, C, G, and {\{}T{\}} nucleotides at positions ?3 to +3 around mutated or unmutated A, C, and G nucleotides, we have identified flanking sequences that most commonly surround mutated bases. Distinct trends in flanking sequences that were unique for each base were observed. Statistically significant trends that were common to both IgVH4.21 and 251 were used to deduce motifs that bias somatic hypermutation. The motifs deduced from this data, with targeted bases in regular type, are AANB, WDCH, and DGHD (where W = A/{\{}T{\}}, {\{}B{\}} = C/G/{\{}T{\}}, D = A/G/{\{}T{\}}, H = A/C/{\{}T{\}}, and N = any base). Mutations from C and G in two further groups of out-of-frame human IgVH genes, not used in the deduction of the motifs, occurred significantly within the motifs for C and G. The proposed target sequence for G is within the reverse complement of the target sequence for C, suggesting that the hypermutation mechanism may target only G or C. The mutation in the complementary base would appear on the other strand following replication.},

The length preferences vary depending on the MHC allele, but are generally limited to peptides of length 8-11 amino acids. On this relatively simple system, we developed a sequence alignment method based on artificial neural networks that allows insertions and deletions in the alignment. RESULTS We show that prediction methods based on alignments that include insertions and deletions have significantly higher performance than methods trained on peptides of single lengths. Also, we illustrate how the location of deletions can aid the interpretation of the modes of binding of the peptide-MHC, as in the case of long peptides bulging out of the MHC groove or protruding at either terminus. Finally, we demonstrate that the method can learn the length profile of different MHC molecules, and quantified the reduction of the experimental effort required to identify potential epitopes using our prediction algorithm.

abstract = {The na{\"{i}}ve immunoglobulin repertoire in the blood differs from the direct output of the rearrangement process. These differences stem from selection that affects the germline gene usage and the junctional nucleotides. A major complication obscuring the details of the selection mechanism in the heavy chain is the failure to properly identify the D germline and determine the nucleotide addition and deletion in the junction region. The selection affecting junctional diversity can however be studied in the light chain that has no D gene. We use probabilistic and deterministic models to infer and disentangle generation and selection of the light chain, using large samples of light chains sequenced from healthy donors and transgenic mice. We have previously used similar models for the Beta chain of T-cell receptors and the heavy chain of immunoglobulins . Selection is observed mainly in the CDR3. The CDR3 length and mass distributions are narrower after selection than before, indicating stabilizing selection for mid-range values. Within the CDR3, Proline and Cysteine undergo negative selection while Glycine undergoes positive selection. The results presented here suggest structural selection maintaining the size of the CDR3 within a limited range, and preventing turns in the CDR3 region.},

abstract = {Developing thymocytes are screened for self-reactivity before they exit the thymus, but how thymocytes scan the medulla for self antigens is unclear. Using two-photon microscopy, we observed that medullary thymocytes migrated rapidly and made frequent, transient contacts with dendritic cells. In the presence of a negative selecting ligand, thymocytes slowed, became confined to areas of approximately 30 microm in diameter and had increased contact with dendritic cells surrounding confinement zones. One third of polyclonal medullary thymocytes also showed confined, slower migration and may correspond to autoreactive thymocytes. Our data suggest that many autoreactive thymocytes do not undergo immediate arrest and death after encountering a negative selecting ligand but instead adopt an altered migration program while remaining in the medullary microenvironment.},

abstract = {Hypervariable T-cell receptors (TCR) play a key role in adaptive immunity, recognising a vast diversity of pathogen-derived antigens. High throughput sequencing of TCR repertoires (RepSeq) produces huge datasets of T-cell receptor sequences from blood and tissue samples. However, our ability to extract clinically relevant information from RepSeq data is limited, mainly because little is known about TCR-disease associations. Here we present a statistical approach called ALICE (Antigen-specific Lymphocyte Identification by Clustering of Expanded sequences) that identifies TCR sequences that are actively involved in the current immune response from a single RepSeq sample, and apply it to repertoires of patients with a variety of disorders - autoimmune disease (ankylosing spondylitis), patients under cancer immunotherapy, or subject to an acute infection (live yellow fever vaccine). The method's robustness is demonstrated by the agreement of its predictions with independent assays, and is supported by its ability to selectively detect responding TCR in the memory but not in the naive subset. ALICE requires no longitudinal data collection nor large cohorts, and is thus directly applicable to most RepSeq datasets. Its results facilitate the identification of TCR variants associated with a wide variety of diseases and conditions, which can be used for diagnostics, rational vaccine design and evaluation of the adaptive immune system state.},

abstract = {Traditional vaccine development to prevent some of the worst current pandemic diseases has been unsuccessful so far. Germline-targeting immunogens have potential to prime protective antibodies (Abs) via more targeted immune responses. Success of germline-targeting vaccines in humans will depend on the composition of the human naive B cell repertoire, including the frequencies and affinities of epitope-specific B cells. However, the human naive B cell repertoire remains largely undefined. Assessment of antigen-specific human naive B cells among hundreds of millions of B cells from multiple donors may be used as pre-phase 1 ex vivo human testing to potentially forecast B cell and Ab responses to new vaccine designs. VRC01 is an HIV broadly neutralizing Ab (bnAb) against the envelope CD4-binding site (CD4bs). We characterized naive human B cells recognizing eOD-GT8, a germline-targeting HIV-1 vaccine candidate immunogen designed to prime VRC01-class Abs. Several distinct subclasses of VRC01-class naive B cells were identified, sharing sequence characteristics with inferred precursors of known bnAbs VRC01, VRC23, PCIN63, and N6. Multiple naive B cell clones exactly matched mature VRC01-class bnAb L-CDR3 sequences. Non-VRC01-class B cells were also characterized, revealing recurrent public light chain sequences. Unexpectedly, we also identified naive B cells related to the IOMA-class CD4bs bnAb. These different subclasses within the human repertoire had strong initial affinities (KD) to the immunogen, up to 13 nM, and represent encouraging indications that multiple independent pathways may exist for vaccine-elicited VRC01-class bnAb development in most individuals. The frequencies of these distinct eOD-GT8 B cell specificities give insights into antigen-specific compositional features of the human naive B cell repertoire and provide actionable information for vaccine design and advancement.},

We show that the resulting biases in both V(D)J usage and N/P addition lengths, which are found in na{\"{i}}ve and antigen experienced cells, contribute to significant variation in the CDR3 region. Moreover, we show that the relative usage of V and J gene segments is chromosomally biased, with ∼1.5 times as many rearrangements originating from a single chromosome.

abstract = {We consider the lifetime of a T cell clonotype, the set of T cells with the same T cell receptor, from its thymic origin to its extinction in a multiclonal repertoire. Using published estimates of total cell numbers and thymic production rates, we calculate the mean number of cells per TCR clonotype, and the total number of clonotypes, in mice and humans. When there is little peripheral division, as in a mouse, the number of cells per clonotype is small and governed by the number of cells with identical TCR that exit the thymus. In humans, peripheral division is important and a clonotype may survive for decades, during which it expands to comprise many cells. We therefore devise and analyse a computational model of homeostasis of a multiclonal population. Each T cell in the model competes for self pMHC stimuli, cells of any one clonotype only recognising a small fraction of the many subsets of stimuli. A constant mean total number of cells is maintained by a balance between cell division and death, and a stable number of clonotypes by a balance between thymic production of new clonotypes and extinction of existing ones. The number of distinct clonotypes in a human body may be smaller than the total number of naive T cells by only one order of magnitude.},

However, the evolutionary processes that sculpt antibody repertoires remain poorly understood. Here, using an unbiased repertoire-scale approach, we show that the population genetic signatures of evolution are evident in human B cell lineages and reveal how antibodies evolve somatically. We measured the dynamics and genetic diversity of B cell responses in five adults longitudinally before and after influenza vaccination using high-throughput antibody repertoire sequencing. We identified vaccine-responsive B cell lineages that carry signatures of selective sweeps driven by positive selection, and discovered that they often display evidence for selective sweeps favoring multiple subclones. We also found persistent B cell lineages that exhibit stable population dynamics and carry signatures of neutral drift. By exploiting the relationship between B cell fitness and antibody binding affinity, we demonstrate the potential for using phylogenetic approaches to identify antibodies with high binding affinity. This quantitative characterization reveals that antibody repertoires are shaped by an unexpectedly broad spectrum of evolutionary processes and shows how signatures of evolutionary history can be harnessed for antibody discovery and engineering.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: To create the enormous diversity of 10(12) immunoglobulins (IG) and T cell receptors (TR) per individual, very complex mechanisms occur at the DNA level: the combinatorial diversity results from the junction of the variable (V), diversity (D) and joining (J) genes; the N-diversity represents the addition at random of nucleotides not encoded in the genome; and somatic hypermutations occur in IG rearranged sequences. The accurate annotation of the junction between V, D, J genes in rearranged IG and TR sequences represents therefore a huge challenge by its uniqueness and complexity. We developed IMGT/JunctionAnalysis to analyse automatically in detail the IG and TR junctions, according to the IMGT Scientific chart rules, based on the IMGT-ONTOLOGY concepts. RESULTS: IMGT/JunctionAnalysis is the first tool for the detailed analysis of the IG and TR complex V-J and V-D-J JUNCTION(s). It delimits, at the nucleotide level, the genes resulting from the combinatorial diversity. It identifies accurately the D genes in the junctions of IG heavy (IGH), TR beta (TRB) and delta (TRD) chains. It delimits the palindromic P-REGION(s) and the N-REGION(s) resulting from the N-diversity. It evaluates the number of somatic hypermutations for each gene, within the JUNCTION. IMGT/JunctionAnalysis is capable of analysing, in a single run, an unlimited number of junctions from the same species (currently human or mouse) and from the same locus.

abstract = {Without therapy, most people infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) ultimately progress to AIDS. Rare individuals ('elite controllers') maintain very low levels of HIV RNA without therapy, thereby making disease progression and transmission unlikely. Certain HLA class I alleles are markedly enriched in elite controllers, with the highest association observed for HLA-B57 (ref. 1). Because HLA molecules present viral peptides that activate CD8(+) T cells, an immune-mediated mechanism is probably responsible for superior control of HIV. Here we describe how the peptide-binding characteristics of HLA-B57 molecules affect thymic development such that, compared to other HLA-restricted T cells, a larger fraction of the naive repertoire of B57-restricted clones recognizes a viral epitope, and these T cells are more cross-reactive to mutants of targeted epitopes. Our calculations predict that such a T-cell repertoire imposes strong immune pressure on immunodominant HIV epitopes and emergent mutants, thereby promoting efficient control of the virus. Supporting these predictions, in a large cohort of HLA-typed individuals, our experiments show that the relative ability of HLA-B alleles to control HIV correlates with their peptide-binding characteristics that affect thymic development. Our results provide a conceptual framework that unifies diverse empirical observations, and have implications for vaccination strategies.},

abstract = {T-cell specificity is determined by the T-cell receptor, a heterodimeric protein coded for by an extremely diverse set of genes produced by imprecise somatic gene recombination. Massively parallel high-throughput sequencing allows millions of different T-cell receptor genes to be characterized from a single sample of blood or tissue. However, the extraordinary heterogeneity of the immune repertoire poses significant challenges for subsequent analysis of the data. We outline the major steps in processing of repertoire data, considering low-level processing of raw sequence files and high-level algorithms, which seek to extract biological or pathological information. The latest generation of bioinformatics tools allows millions of DNA sequences to be accurately and rapidly assigned to their respective variable V and J gene segments, and to reconstruct an almost error-free representation of the non-templated additions and deletions that occur. High-level processing can measure the diversity of the repertoire in different samples, quantify V and J usage and identify private and public T-cell receptors. Finally, we discuss the major challenge of linking T-cell receptor sequence to function, and specifically to antigen recognition. Sophisticated machine learning algorithms are being developed that can combine the paradoxical degeneracy and cross-reactivity of individual T-cell receptors with the specificity of the overall T-cell immune response. Computational analysis will provide the key to unlock the potential of the T-cell receptor repertoire to give insight into the fundamental biology of the adaptive immune system and to provide powerful biomarkers of disease.},

abstract = {Previous experiments with mouse chimeras demonstrated that cellular competition for antigen-specific survival signals plays a crucial role in the maintenance of the naive B cell repertoire. Transgenic (Tg) B cell populations in these chimeras have a shortened lifespan and poor competitive abilities as compared to more diverse non-Tg populations in the same mice. We develop a mathematical model to investigate the mechanism of B cell competition. The model allows for various B cell clones, generated in the bone marrow, to go into the peripheral circulation, where they compete specifically for various ligands providing survival signals. In the model we also find the observed poor competitive abilities of the Tg repertoire. Investigating the nature of the competition in the model, we find that most of the competition is "intraspecific" occurring largely within the clone of truly Tg B cells, and within the repertoire of leaky Tg and non-Tg B cells. This is confirmed by analysing a simplified version of the model, which only allows for intraspecific competition, and resembles a simple ecological model with density-dependent death. The fact that our model accounts for the data, casts doubt on a previous interpretation of the same data arguing that more diverse repertoires outcompete repertoires of lower diversity. Here, we conclude that most of the data can be explained with intraspecific competition, and formulate an experimental prediction that allows one to distinguish between the previous interpretation of inter-specific competition between repertoires, and the current interpretation of intraspecific competition.},

abstract = {Vaccination induces “public” antibody clonotypes common to all individuals of a species, that may mediate universal protection against pathogens. Only few studies tried to trace back the origin of these public B-cell clones. Here we used Illumina sequencing and computational modeling to unveil the mechanisms shaping the structure of the fish memory antibody response against an attenuated Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia rhabdovirus. After vaccination, a persistent memory response with a public VH5JH5 IgM component was composed of dominant antibodies shared among all individuals. The rearrangement model showed that these public junctions occurred with high probability indicating that they were already favored before vaccination due to the recombination process, as shown in mammals. In addition, these clonotypes were in the na{\"{i}}ve repertoire associated with larger similarity classes, composed of junctions differing only at one or two positions by amino acids with comparable properties. The model showed that this property was due to selective processes exerted between the recombination and the naive repertoire. Finally, our results showed that public clonotypes greatly expanded after vaccination displayed several VDJ junctions differing only by one or two amino acids with similar properties, highlighting a convergent response. The fish public memory antibody response to a virus is therefore shaped at three levels: by recombination biases, by selection acting on the formation of the pre-vaccination repertoire, and by convergent selection of functionally similar clonotypes during the response. We also show that naive repertoires of IgM and IgT have different structures and sharing between individuals, due to selection biases. In sum, our comparative approach identifies three conserved features of the antibody repertoire associated with public memory responses. These features were already present in the last common ancestors of fish and mammals, while other characteristics may represent species-specific solutions.},

abstract = {The adaptive immune system has to economically generate a large array of T and B cell antigen receptors (T cell receptors [TCRs], B cell receptors [BCRs]) that eliminate both longstanding and novel antigens from the host while preventing the production of deleterious (e.g., autoreactive) antigen receptors. Our studies focus on the mechanisms that shape the development of these antigen receptor repertoires during human ontogeny. The key to BCR and TCR diversity is the third complementarity determining region (CDR3) of the variable domain, which in the immunoglobulin heavy chain and TCR beta chain, is created by the junction between the variable, diversity, and joining gene segments. The CDR3 diversity is constrained by overrepresentation of gene segments and lack of N regions during the first trimester of gestation and then increases exponentially during ontogeny until it reaches adult levels months after birth. This process parallels, and may contribute to, the stepwise acquisition of the ability to respond to specific antigens. Recent studies indicate that maturation of the CDR3 repertoire is not accelerated by premature exposition to extrauterine antigen and thus appears to follow a strictly developmentally regulated program whose pacemaker(s) is still unknown.},

abstract = {Peripheral T cell populations are maintained by production of naive T cells in the thymus, clonal expansion of activated cells, cellular self-renewal (or homeostatic proliferation), and density dependent cell life spans. A variety of experimental techniques have been employed to quantify the relative contributions of these processes. In modern studies lymphocytes are typically labeled with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU), deuterium, or the fluorescent dye carboxy-fluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE), their division history has been studied by monitoring telomere shortening and the dilution of T cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) or the dye CFSE, and clonal expansion has been documented by recording changes in the population densities of antigen specific cells. Proper interpretation of such data in terms of the underlying rates of T cell production, division, and death has proven to be notoriously difficult and involves mathematical modeling.We review the various models that have been developed for each of these techniques, discuss which models seem most appropriate for what type of data, reveal open problems that require better models, and pinpoint how the assumptions underlying a mathematical model may influence the interpretation of data. Elaborating various successful cases where modeling has delivered new insights in T cell population dynamics, this review provides quantitative estimates of several processes involved in the maintenance of naive and memory, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell pools in mice and men. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The final set of these molecules in each organism is formed under the influence of two forces: individual genetic traits and the environment, which includes the diverse spectra of alien and self-antigens. Here we assess the impact of individual genetic factors on the formation of the adaptive immunity by analyzing the T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoires of three pairs of monozygous twins by next-generation sequencing. Surprisingly, we found that an overlap between the TCR repertoires of monozygous twins is similar to an overlap between the TCR repertoires of nonrelated individuals. However, the number of identical complementary determining region 3 sequences in two individuals is significantly increased for twin pairs in the fraction of highly abundant TCR molecules, which is enriched by the antigen-experienced T cells. We found that the initial recruitment of particular TCR V genes for recombination and subsequent selection in the thymus is strictly determined by individual genetic factors. J genes of TCRs are selected randomly for recombination; however, the subsequent selection in the thymus gives preference to some $\alpha$ but not $\beta$ J segments. These findings provide a deeper insight into the mechanism of TCR repertoire generation.},

abstract = {Complex mathematical models of interaction networks are routinely used for prediction in systems biology. However, it is difficult to reconcile network complexities with a formal understanding of their behavior. Here, we propose a simple procedure (called ϕ¯) to reduce biological models to functional submodules, using statistical mechanics of complex systems combined with a fitness-based approach inspired by in silico evolution. The ϕ¯ algorithm works by putting parameters or combination of parameters to some asymptotic limit, while keeping (or slightly improving) the model performance, and requires parameter symmetry breaking for more complex models. We illustrate ϕ¯ on biochemical adaptation and on different models of immune recognition by T cells. An intractable model of immune recognition with close to a hundred individual transition rates is reduced to a simple two-parameter model. The ϕ¯ algorithm extracts three different mechanisms for early immune recognition, and automatically discovers similar functional modules in different models of the same process, allowing for model classification and comparison. Our procedure can be applied to biological networks based on rate equations using a fitness function that quantifies phenotypic performance.},

abstract = {The efficient recognition of pathogens by the adaptive immune system relies on the diversity of receptors displayed at the surface of immune cells. {\{}T{\}}-cell receptor diversity results from an initial random DNA editing process, called VDJ recombination, followed by functional selection of cells according to the interaction of their surface receptors with self and foreign antigenic peptides. Using high-throughput sequence data from the $\beta$-chain of human {\{}T{\}}-cell receptors, we infer factors that quantify the overall effect of selection on the elements of receptor sequence composition: the V and J gene choice and the length and amino acid composition of the variable region. We find a significant correlation between biases induced by VDJ recombination and our inferred selection factors together with a reduction of diversity during selection. Both effects suggest that natural selection acting on the recombination process has anticipated the selection pressures experienced during somatic evolution. The inferred selection factors differ little between donors or between naive and memory repertoires. The number of sequences shared between donors is well-predicted by our model, indicating a stochastic origin of such public sequences. Our approach is based on a probabilistic maximum likelihood method, which is necessary to disentangle the effects of selection from biases inherent in the recombination process.},

Unlike those from normal adults, receptor genes from adult mutant mice show extensive evidence of homology-directed recombination, suggesting that TdT blocks this process.

To fully capture this evolution, we need to describe the complex dynamics of the response to pathogenic and self-antigenic stimulations, as well as the statistics of novel lymphocyte receptors introduced throughout life. Recent experiments, ranging from high-throughput immune repertoire sequencing to quantification of the response to specific antigens, can help us characterize the effective dynamics of the immune response. Here we describe mathematical models informed by experiments that lead to a picture of clonal competition in a highly stochastic context. We discuss how different types of competition, noise and selection shape the observed clone-size distributions, and contrast them with predictions of a neutral theory of clonal evolution. These mathematical models show that memory and effector immune repertoire evolution is far from neutral, and is driven by the history of the pathogenic environment, while naive repertoire dynamics are consistent with neutral theory and competition in a fixed antigenic environment. Lastly, we investigate the effect of long-term clonal selection on repertoire aging.},

In this study, using the well-characterized mouse influenza virus model, we show that although comparable numbers of CD8 T cells are elicited in the lung and lung airways of young and aged mice after de novo infection, a majority of aged mice exhibit profound shifts in epitope immunodominance and restricted diversity in the TCR repertoire of responding cells. A preferential decline in reactivity to viral epitopes with a low naive precursor frequency was observed, in some cases leading to "holes" in the T cell repertoire. These effects were also seen in young thymectomized mice, consistent with the role of the thymus in maintaining naive repertoire diversity. Furthermore, a decline in repertoire diversity generally correlated with impaired responses to heterosubtypic challenge. This study formally demonstrates in a mouse infection model that naturally occurring contraction of the naive T cell repertoire can result in impaired CD8 T cell responses to known immunodominant epitopes and decline in heterosubtypic immunity. These observations have important implications for the design of vaccine strategies for the elderly.},

Certain signatures are associated with age of the patient at cancer diagnosis, known mutagenic exposures or defects in DNA maintenance, but many are of cryptic origin. In addition to these genome-wide mutational signatures, hypermutation localized to small genomic regions, 'kataegis', is found in many cancer types.

We review here classical technologies and analysis strategies developed to assess immunoglobulin (IG) and {\{}T{\}} cell receptor (TR) repertoire diversity, and describe recent advances in the field. First, we describe the broad range of available methodological tools developed in the past decades, each of which answering different questions and showing complementarity for progressive identification of the level of repertoire alterations: global overview of the diversity by flow cytometry, IG repertoire descriptions at the protein level for the identification of IG reactivities, IG/TR CDR3 spectratyping strategies, and related molecular quantification or dynamics of T/{\{}B{\}} cell differentiation. Additionally, we introduce the recent technological advances in molecular biology tools allowing deeper analysis of IG/TR diversity by next-generation sequencing (NGS), offering systematic and comprehensive sequencing of IG/TR transcripts in a short amount of time. NGS provides several angles of analysis such as clonotype frequency, CDR3 diversity, CDR3 sequence analysis, V allele identification with a quantitative dimension, therefore requiring high-throughput analysis tools development. In this line, we discuss the recent efforts made for nomenclature standardization and ontology development. We then present the variety of available statistical analysis and modeling approaches developed with regards to the various levels of diversity analysis, and reveal the increasing sophistication of those modeling approaches. To conclude, we provide some examples of recent mathematical modeling strategies and perspectives that illustrate the active rise of a “next-generation” of repertoire analysis.},

abstract = {Traditional vaccine development to prevent some of the worst current pandemic diseases has been unsuccessful so far. Germline-targeting immunogens have potential to prime protective antibodies (Abs) via more targeted immune responses. Success of germline-targeting vaccines in humans will depend on the composition of the human naive B cell repertoire, including the frequencies and affinities of epitope-specific B cells. However, the human naive B cell repertoire remains largely undefined. Assessment of antigen-specific human naive B cells among hundreds of millions of B cells from multiple donors may be used as pre-phase 1 ex vivo human testing to potentially forecast B cell and Ab responses to new vaccine designs. VRC01 is an HIV broadly neutralizing Ab (bnAb) against the envelope CD4-binding site (CD4bs). We characterized naive human B cells recognizing eOD-GT8, a germline-targeting HIV-1 vaccine candidate immunogen designed to prime VRC01-class Abs. Several distinct subclasses of VRC01-class naive B cells were identified, sharing sequence characteristics with inferred precursors of known bnAbs VRC01, VRC23, PCIN63, and N6. Multiple naive B cell clones exactly matched mature VRC01-class bnAb L-CDR3 sequences. Non-VRC01-class B cells were also characterized, revealing recurrent public light chain sequences. Unexpectedly, we also identified naive B cells related to the IOMA-class CD4bs bnAb. These different subclasses within the human repertoire had strong initial affinities (KD) to the immunogen, up to 13 nM, and represent encouraging indications that multiple independent pathways may exist for vaccine-elicited VRC01-class bnAb development in most individuals. The frequencies of these distinct eOD-GT8 B cell specificities give insights into antigen-specific compositional features of the human naive B cell repertoire and provide actionable information for vaccine design and advancement.},

abstract = {Deep learning algorithms have been utilized to achieve excellent performance in pattern-recognition tasks, such as in image and vocal recognition. The ability to learn complex patterns in data has tremendous implications in the genomics world, where sequence motifs become learned features that can be used to predict functionality, guiding our understanding of disease and basic biology. T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing assesses the diversity of the adaptive immune system, and while prior conventional biological sequence analysis tools have been insightful, they have significant shortcomings. Prior approaches have been limited to single-sequence analytics and thus unable to characterize the overall structural information within an entire sample of sequences. Furthermore, they utilize only unsupervised approaches, being unable to leverage labels to guide the learning process. We present DeepTCR, a broad collection of unsupervised and supervised deep learning methods able to uncover structure in highly complex and large TCR sequencing data. We demonstrate its utility across multiple scientific examples, including learning antigen-specific motifs to viral and tumor-specific epitopes and understanding immunotherapy-related shaping of repertoire. We further extract meaningful motifs from the trained network as a means of explaining the sequence concepts that have been learned to accomplish a given task. Finally, we extend DeepTCR functionality to analyze paired alpha/beta chains as inputs, demonstrating the ability to query the contribution of each chain to antigen-specificity. Our results show the flexibility and capacity for deep neural networks to handle the complexity of high-dimensional genomics data for both descriptive and predictive purposes.},

We identified a single cross-reaction consisting of an anti-self TCR recognizing a poxvirus peptide at relatively low sensitivity. We failed to identify any cross-reactions between the synthetic peptides in the panel and polyclonal CD8+ T cells raised to viral or alloantigens. These findings provide the best estimate to date of the frequency of T cell cross-reactivity to unrelated peptides ( approximately 1/30,000), explaining why cross-reactions between unrelated pathogens are infrequently encountered and providing a critical parameter for understanding the scope of self-tolerance.},

To determine whether pathogen exposure signatures can be identified by documenting public T cell receptors (TCRs), we profiled the T cell repertoire of 666 subjects with known cytomegalovirus (CMV) serostatus by immunosequencing. We developed a statistical classification framework that could diagnose CMV status from the resulting catalog of TCR$\beta$ sequences with high specificity and sensitivity in both the original cohort and a validation cohort of 120 different subjects. We also confirmed that three of the identified CMV-associated TCR$\beta$ molecules bind CMV in vitro, and, moreover, we used this approach to accurately predict the HLA-A and HLA-B alleles of most subjects in the first cohort. As all memory T cell responses are encoded in the common format of somatic TCR recombination, our approach could potentially be generalized to a wide variety of disease states, as well as other immunological phenotypes, as a highly parallelizable diagnostic strategy.},

abstract = {The primary cause of poor outcome following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is disease recurrence. Detection of increasing minimal residual disease (MRD) following HCT may permit early intervention to prevent clinical relapse; however, MRD quantification remains an uncommon diagnostic test because of logistical and financial barriers to widespread use. Here we describe a method for quantifying CLL MRD using widely available consensus primers for amplification of all Ig heavy chain (IGH) genes in a mixture of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, followed by high-throughput sequencing (HTS) for disease-specific IGH sequence quantification. To achieve accurate MRD quantification, we developed a systematic bioinformatic methodology to aggregate cancer clone sequence variants arising from systematic and random artifacts occurring during IGH-HTS. We then compared the sensitivity of IGH-HTS, flow cytometry, and allele-specific oligonucleotide PCR for MRD quantification in 28 samples collected from 6 CLL patients following allogeneic HCT. Using amplimer libraries generated with consensus primers from patient blood samples, we demonstrate the sensitivity of IGH-HTS with 454 pyrosequencing to be 10-5, with a high correlation between quantification by allele-specific oligonucleotide PCR and IGH-HTS (r = 0.85). From the same dataset used to quantify MRD, IGH-HTS also allowed us to profile IGHrepertoire reconstitution after HCT-information not provided by the other MRD methods. IGH-HTS using consensus primers will broaden the availability of MRD quantification in CLL and other B cell malignancies, and this approach has potential for quantitative evaluation of immune diversification following transplant and nontransplant therapies.},

abstract = {T cell receptors (TCRs) and immunoglobulins (Igs) derive a large fraction of their repertoire from diversity generated at the junctions of the V, D, and J coding segments. This diversity is derived both from the random deletion of nucleotides from the ends of coding regions and from the subsequent addition of nontemplated N region nucleotides. While the vast majority of TCRs and Igs from adult mice have N regions, less than 5{\%} of both TCR-gamma/delta and Ig from fetal and neonatal mice have N regions. This study analyzed the ontogeny of junctional diversity of TCR-alpha/beta. Genomic DNA or C beta-primed cDNA was prepared from thymocytes of mice at varying stages in ontogeny, and the rearranged V beta 8 or V beta 5 sequences were amplified by polymerase chain reactions. Sequencing of the V beta-D beta-J beta junctions showed few N regions early in ontogeny, although the fraction of sequences with N regions exceeded that previously reported for Ig and for TCR-gamma/delta. N regions were found in 13{\%} of V beta junctional sequences from day 18-19 fetal thymocytes, 33{\%} of sequences from newborn thymocytes, 76{\%} of sequences from day 4 postnatal thymocytes, and 88{\%} of sequences from 5-wk-old thymocytes. In addition, nonrandom usage of the D beta and J beta segments was observed in both fetal and adult TCR sequences. While the usage of each of the six J beta 2 segments was different, the same pattern of usage was seen regardless of whether D beta 1 or D beta 2 was used, suggesting that a factor controlling the rate of usage of each J segment is intrinsic to the J gene itself. Since TCRs derive so much of their diversity from N regions, the relative paucity of N regions in fetal alpha/beta T cells would create a fetal TCR-alpha/beta repertoire that would be quite different from, and smaller than, the adult repertoire. The lack of N regions might be predicted to limit the range of affinities of TCR-MHC + peptide interactions, which may have important consequences for positive and negative selection of fetal and newborn T cells.},

abstract = {The advent of cancer immunotherapy has generated renewed hope for the treatment of many malignancies by introducing a number of novel strategies that exploit various properties of the immune system. These therapies are based on the idea that cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) directly recognize and respond to tumor-associated neoantigens (TANs) in much the same way as they would to foreign peptides presented on cell surfaces. To date, however, nearly all attempts to optimize immunotherapeutic strategies have been empirical. Here, we develop a model of T cell selection based on the assumption of random interaction strengths between a self-peptide and the various T cell receptors. The model enables the analytical study of the effects of selection on the CTL recognition of TANs and completely foreign peptides and can estimate the number of CTLs that can detect donor-matched transplants. We show that negative selection thresholds chosen to reflect experimentally observed thymic survival rates result in near-optimal production of T cells that are capable of surviving selection and recognizing foreign antigen. These analytical results are confirmed by simulation.},

abstract = {What are the rules that govern a naive T cell's prospects for survival or division after export from the thymus into the periphery? To help address these questions, we combine data from existing studies with robust mathematical models to estimate the absolute contributions of thymopoiesis, peripheral division, and loss or differentiation to the human naive CD4+ T-cell pool between the ages of 0 and 20 years. Despite their decline in frequency in the blood, total body numbers of naive CD4+ T cells increase throughout childhood and early adulthood. Our analysis shows that postthymic proliferation contributes more than double the number of cells entering the pool each day from the thymus. This ratio is preserved with age; as the thymus involutes, the average time between naive T-cell divisions in the periphery lengthens. We also show that the expected residence time of naive T cells increases with time. The naive CD4+ T-cell population thus becomes progressively less dynamic with age. Together with other studies, our results suggest a complex picture of naive T-cell homeostasis in which population size, time since export from the thymus, or time since the last division can influence a cell's prospects for survival or further divisions. {\textcopyright} 2009 by The American Society of Hematology.},

Here, we developed a consensus read sequencing approach that incorporates unique barcode labels on each starting RNA molecule. These labels allow one to combine multiple sequencing reads covering the same RNA molecule to reduce the error rate to a desired level, and they also enable accurate quantification of RNA and isotype levels. We validated this approach and analyzed the differential response of the antibody repertoire to live-attenuated or trivalent-inactivated influenza vaccination. Additionally, we analyzed the antibody repertoire in response to repeated yearly vaccinations with trivalent-inactivated influenza vaccination.

Detailed molecular analysis of T-cell receptors expressed by lymphocytes was obtained by generating a large number of junctional regions sequences from TCRBV3, TCRBV4, TCRBV5S1, TCRBV12, TCRBV13S2, TCRBV17, TCRBV20, and TCRBV22 variable genes. The {\textgreater} 800 sequences analyzed have allowed the characterization of the recombination frequencies of each germline-encoded V, D, and J segments, as well as of the magnitude of exonucleolytic nibbling and of the number of N nucleotides inserted for each group of TCRB segments. The data obtained indicate that the extent of junctional diversity varies considerably depending on the TCRBV gene implicated in the recombination event, due to the occurrence of skewed patterns of J and D region usage. Furthermore, our results show that "illegitimate" rearrangements occur with unexpectedly high incidence, specifically at the level of TCRBD to TCRBJ joining. These findings provide additional information for a more accurate estimation of the size of the TCRBV repertoire and for understanding the well-established biased pattern of TCRBV expression in humans.},

Thus, data about the mature repertoire may be used to infer information on how TCR generation and selection operate. Assuming that T cell selection is affinity driven, we derive the quantitative constraints that the parameters driving these processes must fulfill to account for the experimentally observed levels of alloreactivity, self MHC restriction and the frequency of cells recognizing a given foreign Ag. We find that affinity-driven selection is compatible with experimental estimates of these latter quantities only if 1) TCRs see more peptide residues than MHC polymorphic residues, 2) the majority of positively selected clones are deleted by negative selection, 3) between 1 and 3.6 clonal divisions occur on average in the thymus after completion of TCR rearrangement, and 4) selection is driven by 103-105 self peptides.},

abstract = {Antibody repertoire diversity, potentially as high as 1011 unique molecules in a single individual, confounds characterization by conventional sequence analyses. In this study, we present a general method for assessing human antibody sequence diversity displayed on phage using massively parallel pyrosequencing, a novel application of Kabat column-labeled profile Hidden Markov Models, and translated complementarity determining region (CDR) capture-recapture analysis. Pyrosequencing of domain amplicon and RCA PCR products generated 1.5 × 106 reads, including more than 1.9 × 105 high quality, full-length sequences of antibody variable fragment (Fv) variable domains. Novel methods for germline and CDR classification and fine characterization of sequence diversity in the 6 CDRs are presented. Diverse germline contributions to the repertoire with random heavy and light chain pairing are observed. All germline families were found to be represented in 1.7 × 104 sequences obtained from repeated panning of the library. While the most variable CDR (CDR-H3) presents significant length and sequence variability, we find a substantial contribution to total diversity from somatically mutated germline encoded CDRs 1 and 2. Using a capture-recapture method, the total diversity of the antibody library obtained from a human donor Immunoglobulin M (IgM) pool was determined to be at least 3.5 × 1010. The results provide insights into the role of IgM diversification, display library construction, and productive germline usages in antibody libraries and the humoral repertoire.},

abstract = {How the TCR repertoire, in concert with risk-associated MHC, imposes susceptibility for autoimmune diseases is incompletely resolved. Due largely to recombinatorial biases, a small fraction of TCR$\alpha$ or $\beta$-chains are shared by most individuals, or public. If public TCR chains modulate a TCR$\alpha$$\beta$ heterodimer's likelihood of productively engaging autoantigen, because they are pervasive and often high frequency, they could also broadly influence disease risk and progression. Prior data, using low-resolution techniques, have identified the heavy use of select public TCR in some autoimmune models. In this study, we assess public repertoire representation in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis at high resolution. Saturation sequencing was used to identify {\textgreater}18 × 10(6) TCR$\beta$ sequences from the CNSs, periphery, and thymi of mice at different stages of autoimmune encephalomyelitis and healthy controls. Analyses indicated the prominent representation of a highly diverse public TCR$\beta$ repertoire in the disease response. Preferential formation of public TCR implicated in autoimmunity was identified in preselection thymocytes, and, consistently, public, disease-associated TCR$\beta$ were observed to be commonly oligoclonal. Increased TCR sharing and a focusing of the public TCR response was seen with disease progression. Critically, comparisons of peripheral and CNS repertoires and repertoires from preimmune and diseased mice demonstrated that public TCR were preferentially deployed relative to nonshared, or private, sequences. Our findings implicate public TCR in skewing repertoire response during autoimmunity and suggest that subsets of public TCR sequences may serve as disease-specific biomarkers or influence disease susceptibility or progression.},

abstract = {A new function is proposed for describing the rate of T cell proliferation in response to peptides on antigen-presenting cells. The model improves an earlier model of ours by allowing for a true maximum proliferation rate of the T cells. This is achieved by a simple change of variables that markedly relaxes the conditions for a conventional quasi-steady-state assumption. The new model has the same "ecological" properties as the previous one. Thus the natural competition in the model allows for regulation of T cell population size in the presence of continuous stimulation by antigen. An important feature is the competitive exclusion of T cell clones recognizing the same peptide with different affinities allowing for "affinity selection". Models for the population dynamics of experienced, na{\"{i}}ve and activated T cells are also developed. These T cell subpopulations compete with one another for antigen. In models with lymphokine production a "proliferation threshold" is obtained that allows for tolerance.},

abstract = {Conventional and regulatory T cells develop in the thymus where they are exposed to samples of self-peptide MHC (pMHC) ligands. This probabilistic process selects for cells within a range of responsiveness that allows the detection of foreign antigen without excessive responses to self. Regulatory T cells are thought to lie at the higher end of the spectrum of acceptable self-reactivity and play a crucial role in the control of autoimmunity and tolerance to innocuous antigens. While many studies have elucidated key elements influencing lineage commitment, we still lack a full understanding of how thymocytes integrate signals obtained by sampling self-peptides to make fate decisions. To address this problem, we apply stochastic models of signal integration by T cells to data from a study quantifying the development of the two lineages using controllable levels of agonist peptide in the thymus. We find two models are able to explain the observations; one in which T cells continually re-assess fate decisions on the basis of multiple summed proximal signals from TCR-pMHC interactions; and another in which TCR sensitivity is modulated over time, such that contact with the same pMHC ligand may lead to divergent outcomes at different stages of development. Neither model requires that T(conv) and T(reg) are differentially susceptible to deletion or that the two lineages need qualitatively different signals for development, as have been proposed. We find additional support for the variable-sensitivity model, which is able to explain apparently paradoxical observations regarding the effect of partial and strong agonists on T(conv) and T(reg) development.},

abstract = {Semi-invariant T cell receptors (TCRs) found on natural killer T (NKT) and mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are characterized by the use of invariant variable (V) and joining (J) gene combinations in the TCR ??-chain, as well as ubiquitous canonical TCR?? amino acid sequences that are dominant in many individuals and similar across species. That they are so prevalent indicates that they occupy an important niche within the immune system. However, these TCRs are produced by a largely random gene recombination process, which seems a risky approach for the immune system to acquire these innate-like cells. We surveyed studies reporting NKT and MAIT TCR?? sequences for six and four different species, respectively. Although the germline nature of the canonical human and mouse NKT and mouse MAIT TCR?? sequences and an overlap of nucleotides between the mouse MAIT-related V?? and J?? genes have been noted in previous studies, in this study we demonstrate that, for all reported species, the canonical TCR?? amino acid sequences can be encoded by at least one germline-derived nucleotide sequence. Moreover, these nucleotide sequences can utilize an overlap between the V?? and J?? genes in their production, which enables them to be produced by a large variety of recombination mechanisms. We investigated the role of these TCR?? features in the production of the canonical NKT and MAIT TCR?? sequences. In computer simulations of a random recombination process involving the invariant NKT and MAIT TCR?? gene combinations for each species, the canonical NKT and MAIT TCR?? sequences were the first or second most generated of all sequences with the CDR3?? length restrictions associated with NKT and MAIT cells. These results suggest that the immune machinery enables the canonical NKT and MAIT TCR?? sequences to be produced with great efficiency through the process of convergent recombination, ensuring their prevalence across individuals and species. ?? 2012 Elsevier GmbH.},

abstract = {Upon infection, B-lymphocytes expressing antibodies specific for the intruding pathogen develop clonal responses triggered by pathogen recognition via the B-cell receptor. The constant region of antibodies produced by such responding clones dictates their functional properties. In teleost fish, the clonal structure of B-cell responses and the respective contribution of the three isotypes IgM, IgD and IgT remain unknown. The expression of IgM and IgT are mutually exclusive, leading to the existence of two B-cell subsets expressing either both IgM and IgD or only IgT. Here, we undertook a comprehensive analysis of the variable heavy chain (VH) domain repertoires of the IgM, IgD and IgT in spleen of homozygous isogenic rainbow trout (Onchorhynchus mykiss) before, and after challenge with a rhabdovirus, the Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia Virus (VHSV), using CDR3-length spectratyping and pyrosequencing of immunoglobulin (Ig) transcripts. In healthy fish, we observed distinct repertoires for IgM, IgD and IgT, respectively, with a few amplified mu and tau junctions, suggesting the presence of IgM- and IgT-secreting cells in the spleen. In infected animals, we detected complex and highly diverse IgM responses involving all VH subgroups, and dominated by a few large public and private clones. A lower number of robust clonal responses involving only a few VH were detected for the mucosal IgT, indicating that both IgM(+) and IgT(+) spleen B cells responded to systemic infection but at different degrees. In contrast, the IgD response to the infection was faint. Although fish IgD and IgT present different structural features and evolutionary origin compared to mammalian IgD and IgA, respectively, their implication in the B-cell response evokes these mouse and human counterparts. Thus, it appears that the general properties of antibody responses were already in place in common ancestors of fish and mammals, and were globally conserved during evolution with possible functional convergences.},

abstract = {Estimation of immunological and microbiological diversity is vital to our understanding of infection and the immune response. For instance, what is the diversity of the T cell repertoire? These questions are partially addressed by high-throughput sequencing techniques that enable identification of immunological and microbiological "species" in a sample. Estimators of the number of unseen species are needed to estimate population diversity from sample diversity. Here we test five widely used non-parametric estimators, and develop and validate a novel method, DivE, to estimate species richness and distribution. We used three independent datasets: (i) viral populations from subjects infected with human T-lymphotropic virus type 1; (ii) T cell antigen receptor clonotype repertoires; and (iii) microbial data from infant faecal samples. When applied to datasets with rarefaction curves that did not plateau, existing estimators systematically increased with sample size. In contrast, DivE consistently and accurately estimated diversity for all datasets. We identify conditions that limit the application of DivE. We also show that DivE can be used to accurately estimate the underlying population frequency distribution. We have developed a novel method that is significantly more accurate than commonly used biodiversity estimators in microbiological and immunological populations.},

abstract = {High-throughput immunoglobulin sequencing promises new insights into the somatic hypermutation and antigen-driven selection processes that underlie B-cell affinity maturation and adaptive immunity. The ability to estimate positive and negative selection from these sequence data has broad applications not only for understanding the immune response to pathogens, but is also critical to determining the role of somatic hypermutation in autoimmunity and B-cell cancers. Here, we develop a statistical framework for Bayesian estimation of Antigen-driven SELectIoN (BASELINe) based on the analysis of somatic mutation patterns. Our approach represents a fundamental advance over previous methods by shifting the problem from one of simply detecting selection to one of quantifying selection. Along with providing a more intuitive means to assess and visualize selection, our approach allows, for the first time, comparative analysis between groups of sequences derived from different germline V(D)J segments. Application of this approach to next-generation sequencing data demonstrates different selection pressures for memory cells of different isotypes. This framework can easily be adapted to analyze other types of DNA mutation patterns resulting from a mutator that displays hot/cold-spots, substitution preference or other intrinsic biases.},

abstract = {To understand the mechanisms underlying the varying patterns of mutations that occur during immune and autoimmune responses, estimates of the somatic hypermutation rate are critical. However, despite its significance, precise estimates of the mutation rate do not currently exist. Microdissection studies of mutating B cell clones provide an opportunity to measure this rate more accurately than previously possible. Each microdissection provides a number of clonally related sequences that, through the analysis of shared mutations, can be genealogically related to each other. The shape of these clonal trees is influenced by many processes, including the hypermutation rate. We have developed two different methods to estimate the mutation rate based on these data. These methods are applied to two sets of experimental data, one from an autoimmune response and one from the antihapten response to (4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl)acetyl (NP). Comparable mutation rates are estimated for both responses, 0.7-0.9 x 10(-3) and 0.9-1.1 x 10(-3) bp(-1) division(-1) for the autoimmune and NP responses, respectively. In addition to comparing the results of the two procedures, we investigate the effect on our estimate of assumptions, such as the fraction of lethal mutations.},

abstract = {T cells orchestrate pathogen-specific adaptive immune responses by identifying peptides derived from pathogenic proteins that are displayed on the surface of infected cells. Host cells also display peptide fragments from the host's own proteins. Incorrectly identifying peptides derived from the body's own proteome as pathogenic can result in autoimmune disease. To minimize autoreactivity, immature T cells that respond to self-peptides are deleted in the thymus by a process called negative selection. However, negative selection is imperfect, and autoreactive T cells exist in healthy individuals. To understand how autoimmunity is yet avoided, without loss of responsiveness to pathogens, we have developed a model of T-cell training and response. Our model shows that T cells reliably respond to infection and avoid autoimmunity because collective decisions made by the T-cell population, rather than the responses of individual T cells, determine biological outcomes. The theory is qualitatively consistent with experimental data and yields a criterion for thymic selection to be adequate for suppressing autoimmunity.},

abstract = {Analyses of somatic hypermutation (SHM) patterns in B cell immunoglobulin (Ig) sequences contribute to our basic understanding of adaptive immunity, and have broad applications not only for understanding the immune response to pathogens, but also to determining the role of SHM in autoimmunity and B cell cancers. Although stochastic, SHM displays intrinsic biases that can confound statistical analysis, especially when combined with the particular codon usage and base composition in Ig sequences. Analysis of B cell clonal expansion, diversification, and selection processes thus critically depends on an accurate background model for SHM micro-sequence targeting (i.e., hot/cold-spots) and nucleotide substitution. Existing models are based on small numbers of sequences/mutations, in part because they depend on data from non-coding regions or non-functional sequences to remove the confounding influences of selection. Here, we combine high-throughput Ig sequencing with new computational analysis methods to produce improved models of SHM targeting and substitution that are based only on synonymous mutations, and are thus independent of selection. The resulting "S5F" models are based on 806,860 Synonymous mutations in 5-mer motifs from 1,145,182 Functional sequences and account for dependencies on the adjacent four nucleotides (two bases upstream and downstream of the mutation). The estimated profiles can explain almost half of the variance in observed mutation patterns, and clearly show that both mutation targeting and substitution are significantly influenced by neighboring bases. While mutability and substitution profiles were highly conserved across individuals, the variability across motifs was found to be much larger than previously estimated. The model and method source code are made available at http://clip.med.yale.edu/SHM.},

The model suggests that the cross-reactivity of a T cell that survives thymic selection is correlated with its affinity for self peptides. In order to survive thymic selection, a T cell with low affinity for all self peptides expressed in the thymus must have high affinity for major histocompatibility complex (MHC), which makes it highly cross-reactive. A T cell with high affinity for any self peptide must have low MHC affinity to survive selection, which makes it highly specific for its cognate peptide. Our model predicts that (1) positive selection reduces by only 17{\%} the number of T cells that can detect any given foreign peptide, even though it eliminates over 95{\%} of pre-selection cells; (2) negative selection decreases the average cross-reactivity of the pre-selection repertoire by fivefold; and (3) T cells responding to foreign peptides similar to self peptides will have a lower average cross-reactivity than cells responding to epitopes dissimilar to self.},

How this diversity captures antigen specificity remains incompletely understood. In this study we use high throughput sequencing to compare the global changes in T cell receptor $\beta$ chain complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3$\beta$) sequences following immunization with ovalbumin administered with complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) or CFA alone. RESULTS The CDR3$\beta$ sequences were deconstructed into short stretches of overlapping contiguous amino acids. The motifs were ranked according to a one-dimensional Bayesian classifier score comparing their frequency in the repertoires of the two immunization classes. The top ranking motifs were selected and used to create feature vectors which were used to train a support vector machine. The support vector machine achieved high classification scores in a leave-one-out validation test reaching : {\textgreater}90{\%} in some cases. SUMMARY The study describes a novel two-stage classification strategy combining a one-dimensional Bayesian classifier with a support vector machine. Using this approach we demonstrate that the frequency of a small number of linear motifs three amino acids in length can accurately identify a CD4 T cell response to ovalbumin against a background response to the complex mixture of antigens which characterize Complete Freund's Adjuvant.

Recon outputs accurate, robust estimates by any of a vast set of complementary diversity measures, including species richness and entropy, at fractional repertoire coverage. It also outputs error bars and power tables, allowing robust comparisons of diversity between individuals and over time.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lymphocyte receptor repertoires are continually shaped throughout the lifetime of an individual in response to environmental and pathogenic exposure. Thus, they may serve as a fingerprint of an individual's ongoing immunological status (e.g., healthy, infected, vaccinated), with far-reaching implications for immunodiagnostics applications. The advent of high-throughput immune repertoire sequencing now enables the interrogation of immune repertoire diversity in an unprecedented and quantitative manner. However, steadily increasing sequencing depth has revealed that immune repertoires vary greatly among individuals in their composition; correspondingly, it has been reported that there are few shared sequences indicative of immunological status ('public clones'). Disconcertingly, this means that the wealth of information gained from repertoire sequencing remains largely unused for determining the current status of immune responses, thereby hampering the implementation of immune-repertoire-based diagnostics.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Here, we introduce a bioinformatics repertoire-profiling framework that possesses the advantage of capturing the diversity and distribution of entire immune repertoires, as opposed to singular public clones. The framework relies on Hill-based diversity profiles composed of a continuum of single diversity indices, which enable the quantification of the extent of immunological information contained in immune repertoires.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We coupled diversity profiles with unsupervised (hierarchical clustering) and supervised (support vector machine and feature selection) machine learning approaches in order to correlate patients' immunological statuses with their B- and T-cell repertoire data. We could predict with high accuracy (greater than or equal to 80 {\%}) a wide range of immunological statuses such as healthy, transplantation recipient, and lymphoid cancer, suggesting as a proof of principle that diversity profiling can recover a large amount of immunodiagnostic fingerprints from immune repertoire data. Our framework is highly scalable as it easily allowed for the analysis of 1000 simulated immune repertoires; this exceeds the size of published immune repertoire datasets by one to two orders of magnitude.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our framework offers the possibility to advance immune-repertoire-based fingerprinting, which may in the future enable a systems immunogenomics approach for vaccine profiling and the accurate and early detection of disease and infection.},

Long HCDR3 regions, often components of HIV-neutralizing Abs, appear to derive not only from incorporation of long D genes and insertion of large N regions but also by usage of multiple D gene segments in tandem. However, comparison of productive and out-of-frame IgH rearrangements revealed a selection bias against long HCDR3 loops, suggesting these may be disproportionately either poorly functional or autoreactive. Our data suggest that developmental selection removes HCDR3 loops containing patches of hydrophobicity, which are commonly found in some auto-antibodies, and at least 69{\%} of the initial productive IgH rearrangements are removed from the repertoire during B cell development. Additionally, we have demonstrated the potential utility of this new technology for vaccine development with the identification in all four individuals of related candidate germline IgH precursors of the HIV-neutralizing Ab 4E10.},

abstract = {Affinity maturation of the antibody response is a fundamental process in adaptive immunity during which {\{}B{\}}-cells activated by infection or vaccination undergo rapid proliferation accompanied by the acquisition of point mutations in their rearranged immunoglobulin (Ig) genes and selection for increased affinity for the eliciting antigen. The rate of somatic hypermutation at any position within an Ig gene is known to depend strongly on the local DNA sequence, and Ig genes have region-specific codon biases that influence the local mutation rate within the gene resulting in increased differential mutability in the regions that encode the antigen-binding domains. We have isolated a set of clonally related natural Ig heavy chain‚{\"{A}}{\`{i}}light chain pairs from an experimentally infected influenza patient, inferred the unmutated ancestral rearrangements and the maturation intermediates, and synthesized all the antibodies using recombinant methods. The lineage exhibits a remarkably uniform rate of improvement of the effective affinity to influenza hemagglutinin (HA) over evolutionary time, increasing 1000-fold overall from the unmutated ancestor to the best of the observed antibodies. Furthermore, analysis of selection reveals that selection and mutation bias were concordant even at the level of maturation to a single antigen. Substantial improvement in affinity to HA occurred along mutationally preferred paths in sequence space and was thus strongly facilitated by the underlying local codon biases.},

abstract = {What are the rules that govern a naive T cell's prospects for survival or division after export from the thymus into the periphery? To help address these questions, we combine data from existing studies with robust mathematical models to estimate the absolute contributions of thymopoiesis, peripheral division, and loss or differentiation to the human naive CD4+ T-cell pool between the ages of 0 and 20 years. Despite their decline in frequency in the blood, total body numbers of naive CD4+ T cells increase throughout childhood and early adulthood. Our analysis shows that postthymic proliferation contributes more than double the number of cells entering the pool each day from the thymus. This ratio is preserved with age; as the thymus involutes, the average time between naive T-cell divisions in the periphery lengthens. We also show that the expected residence time of naive T cells increases with time. The naive CD4+ T-cell population thus becomes progressively less dynamic with age. Together with other studies, our results suggest a complex picture of naive T-cell homeostasis in which population size, time since export from the thymus, or time since the last division can influence a cell's prospects for survival or further divisions.},

abstract = {Understanding T cell homeostasis requires knowledge of the export rate of new T cells from the thymus, a rate that has been surprisingly difficult to estimate. TCR excision circle (TREC) content has been used as a proxy for thymic export, but this quantity is influenced by cell division and loss of naive T cells and is not a direct measure of thymic export. We present in this study a method for quantifying thymic export in humans by combining two simple mathematical models. One uses Ki67 data to calculate the rate of peripheral naive T cell production, whereas the other tracks the dynamics of TRECs. Combining these models allows the contributions of the thymus and cell division to the daily production rate of T cells to be disentangled. The method is illustrated with published data on Ki67 expression and TRECs within naive CD4+ T cells in healthy individuals. We obtain a quantitative estimate for thymic export as a function of age from birth to 20 years. The export rate of T cells from the thymus follows three distinct phases, as follows: an increase from birth to a peak at 1 year, followed by rapid involution until approximately 8 years, and then a more gradual decline until 20 years. The rate of involution shown by our model is compatible with independent estimates of thymic function predicted by thymic epithelial space. Our method allows nonintrusive estimation of thymic output on an individual basis and may provide a means of assessing the role of the thymus in diseases such as HIV.},

abstract = {Detecting selection in B cell Ig sequences is critical to understanding affinity maturation and can provide insights into Ag-driven selection in normal and pathologic immune responses. The most common sequence-based methods for detecting selection analyze the ratio of replacement and silent mutations using a binomial statistical analysis. However, these approaches have been criticized for low sensitivity. An alternative method is based on the analysis of lineage trees constructed from sets of clonally related Ig sequences. Several tree shape measures have been proposed as indicators of selection that can be statistically compared across cohorts. However, we show that tree shape analysis is confounded by underlying experimental factors that are difficult to control for in practice, including the sequencing depth and number of generations in each clone. Thus, although lineage tree shapes may reflect selection, their analysis alone is an unreliable measure of in vivo selection. To usefully capture the information provided by lineage trees, we propose a new method that applies the binomial statistical framework to mutations identified based on lineage tree structure. This hybrid method is able to detect selection with increased sensitivity in both simulated and experimental data sets. We anticipate that this approach will be especially useful in the analysis of large-scale Ig sequencing data sets generated by high-throughput sequencing technologies.},

We applied this framework to data from three pairs of identical twins immunized with the yellow fever vaccine. We identified 500-1500 responding TCRs in each donor and validated them using three independent assays. While the responding TCRs were mostly private, albeit with higher overlap between twins, they could be well predicted using a classifier based on sequence similarity. Our method can also be applied to samples obtained post-infection, making it suitable for systematic discovery of new infection-specific TCRs in the clinic.},

A key feature of the model is that both "local" and "express service" models of rearrangement can be obtained by varying a single parameter that describes the number of gene segments accessible at a time. We find that the window is much larger for Valpha segments than Jalpha segments, which reconciles seemingly conflicting data for the former.

The resulting DNA fragments were fractionated according to size in preparative agarose gel electrophoresis. DNA fragments carrying gene sequences coding for the variable or constant region of k chains were detected by hybridization with purified, 125I-labeled, whole MOPC 321 K MRNA and with its 3'-end half. The pattern of hybridization was completely different in the genomes of embryo cells and of the plasmacytoma. The pattern of embryo DNA showed two components, one of which (molecular weight=6.0 million) hybridized with C-gene sequences and the other (molecular weight=3.9 million) with V-gene sequences. The pattern of the tumor DNA showed a single component that hybridized with both V-gene and C-gene sequences and that is smaller (molecular weight=2.4 million) than either of the components in embryo DNA. The results were interpreted to mean that the Vk and Ck genes, which are some distance away from each other in the embryo cells, are joined to form a contiguous polynucleotide stretch during differentiation of lymphocytes. Such joining occurs in both of the homologous chromosomes. Relevance of these findings with respect to models for V-C gene joining, activation of a specific V k gene, and allelic exclusion in immunoglobulin gene loci is discussed.},

abstract = {Despite the extreme diversity of T cell repertoires, many identical T-cell receptor (TCR) sequences are found in a large number of individual mice and humans. These widely-shared sequences, often referred to as `public', have been suggested to be over-represented due to their potential immune functionality or their ease of generation by V(D)J recombination. Here we show that even for large cohorts the observed degree of sharing of TCR sequences between individuals is well predicted by a model accounting for by the known quantitative statistical biases in the generation process, together with a simple model of thymic selection. Whether a sequence is shared by many individuals is predicted to depend on the number of queried individuals and the sampling depth, as well as on the sequence itself, in agreement with the data. We introduce the degree of publicness conditional on the queried cohort size and the size of the sampled repertoires. Based on these observations we propose a public/private sequence classifier, `PUBLIC' (Public Universal Binary Likelihood Inference Classifier), based on the generation probability, which performs very well even for small cohort sizes.},

abstract = {Millions of T cells are produced in the thymus, each expressing a unique alpha/beta T cell receptor (TCR) capable of binding to a foreign peptide in the binding groove of a host major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule. T cell-mediated immunity to infection is due to the proliferation and differentiation of rare clones in the preimmune repertoire that by chance express TCRs specific for peptide-MHC (pMHC) ligands derived from the microorganism. Here we review recent findings that have altered our understanding of how the preimmune repertoire is established. Recent structural studies indicate that a germline-encoded tendency of TCRs to bind MHC molecules contributes to the MHC bias of T cell repertoires. It has also become clear that the preimmune repertoire contains functionally heterogeneous subsets including recent thymic emigrants, mature naive phenotype cells, memory phenotype cells, and natural regulatory T cells. In addition, sensitive new detection methods have revealed that the repertoire of naive phenotype T cells consists of distinct pMHC-specific populations that consistently vary in size in different individuals. The implications of these new findings for the clonal selection theory, self-tolerance, and immunodominance are discussed.},

How is the stochastic evolution of molecular biological systems shaped by natural selection? Here, we derive a theorem on the fitness flux in a population, defined as the selective effect of its genotype frequency changes. The fitness-flux theorem generalizes Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection to evolutionary processes including mutations, genetic drift, and time-dependent selection. It shows that a generic state of populations is adaptive evolution: there is a positive fitness flux resulting from a surplus of beneficial over deleterious changes. In particular, stationary nonequilibrium evolution processes are predicted to be adaptive. Under specific nonstationary conditions, notably during a decrease in population size, the average fitness flux can become negative. We show that these predictions are in accordance with experiments in bacteria and bacteriophages and with genomic data in Drosophila. Our analysis establishes fitness flux as a universal measure of adaptation in molecular evolution.},

Recently, Ising/Potts models,$\backslash$nalso known as Markov random fields, have been productively$\backslash$napplied to diverse problems in biology, including the prediction$\backslash$nof structural contacts from protein sequence data and the$\backslash$ndescription of neural activity patterns. However, inference of$\backslash$nsuch models is a challenging computational problem that cannot be$\backslash$nsolved exactly. Here, we describe the adaptive cluster expansion$\backslash$n(ACE) method to quickly and accurately infer Ising or Potts$\backslash$nmodels based on correlation data. ACE avoids overfitting by$\backslash$nconstructing a sparse network of interactions sufficient to$\backslash$nreproduce the observed correlation data within the statistical$\backslash$nerror expected due to finite sampling. When convergence of the$\backslash$nACE algorithm is slow, we combine it with a Boltzmann Machine$\backslash$nLearning algorithm (BML). We illustrate this method on a variety$\backslash$nof biological and artificial datasets and compare it to$\backslash$nstate-of-the-art approximate methods such as Gaussian and$\backslash$npseudo-likelihood inference. RESULTS: We show that ACE accurately$\backslash$nreproduces the true parameters of the underlying model when they$\backslash$nare known, and yields accurate statistical descriptions of both$\backslash$nbiological and artificial data. Models inferred by ACE more$\backslash$naccurately describe the statistics of the data, including both$\backslash$nthe constrained low-order correlations and unconstrained$\backslash$nhigher-order correlations, compared to those obtained by faster$\backslash$nGaussian and pseudo-likelihood methods.

Recent advances in quantitative experimental techniques, in particular intracellular labeling and multi-channel flow cytometry, allow one to measure the population structure of proliferating and dying lymphocytes for several generations with high precision. These new experimental techniques require novel quantitative methods of analysis. We review several recent mathematical approaches used to describe and analyze cell proliferation data. Using a rigorous mathematical framework, we show that two commonly used models that are based on the theories of age-structured cell populations and of branching processes, are mathematically identical. We provide several simple analytical solutions for a model in which the distribution of inter-division times follows a gamma distribution and show that this model can fit both simulated and experimental data. We also show that the estimates of some critical kinetic parameters, such as the average inter-division time, obtained by fitting models to data may depend on the assumed distribution of inter-division times, highlighting the challenges in quantitative understanding of cell kinetics.},

abstract = {Information theory provides a constructive criterion for setting up probability distributions on the basis of partial knowledge, and leads to a type of statistical inference which is called the maximum-entropy estimate. It is the least biased estimate possible on the given information; i.e., it is maximally noncomittal with regard to the missing information. If one considers the statistical mechanics as a form of statistical inference rather than as a physical theory, it is found that the usual computational rules, starting with the determination of the partition function, are an immediate consequence of the maximum-entropy principle. In the resulting "subjective statistical mechanics," the usual rules are thus justified independently of any physical argumentm and in particular independently of experimental verification; whether or not the results agree with experiment, they still present the best estimates that could have been made on the basis of the information available. It is concluded that statistical mechanics need not be regarded as a physical theory dependent for its validity on the truth of additional assumptions not contained in the laws of mechanics (such as ergodicity, metric transitivity, equal a priori probabilities, etc.). Furthermore, it is possible to maintain a sharp distinction between its physical and statistical aspects. The former consists of the correct enumeration of the states of a system and their properties; the latter is a straightforward example of statistical inference.},

A well-adapted repertoire should be tuned to the pathogenic environment to reduce the cost of infections. We develop a general framework for predicting the optimal repertoire that minimizes the cost of infections contracted from a given distribution of pathogens. The theory predicts that the immune system will have more receptors for rare antigens than expected from the frequency of encounters; individuals exposed to the same infections will have sparse repertoires that are largely different, but nevertheless exploit cross-reactivity to provide the same coverage of antigens; and the optimal repertoires can be reached via the dynamics of competitive binding of antigens by receptors and selective amplification of stimulated receptors. Our results follow from a tension between the statistics of pathogen detection, which favor a broader receptor distribution, and the effects of cross-reactivity, which tend to concentrate the optimal repertoire onto a few highly abundant clones. Our predictions can be tested in high-throughput surveys of receptor and pathogen diversity.},

abstract = {The stochastic dynamics of T cell receptor (TCR) signaling are studied using a mathematical model intended to capture kinetic proofreading (sensitivity to ligand-receptor binding kinetics) and negative and positive feedback regulation mediated, respectively, by the phosphatase SHP1 and the MAP kinase ERK. The model incorporates protein-protein interactions involved in initiating TCR-mediated cellular responses and reproduces several experimental observations about the behavior of TCR signaling, including robust responses to as few as a handful of ligands (agonist peptide-MHC complexes on an antigen-presenting cell), distinct responses to ligands that bind TCR with different lifetimes, and antagonism. Analysis of the model indicates that TCR signaling dynamics are marked by significant stochastic fluctuations and bistability, which is caused by the competition between the positive and negative feedbacks. Stochastic fluctuations are such that single-cell trajectories differ qualitatively from the trajectory predicted in the deterministic approximation of the dynamics. Because of bistability, the average of single-cell trajectories differs markedly from the deterministic trajectory. Bistability combined with stochastic fluctuations allows for switch-like responses to signals, which may aid T cells in making committed cell-fate decisions. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.},

The measurement of titration curves eliminates the confounding effects of antibody expression and stability inherent to standard deep mutational scanning assays. We demonstrate Tite-Seq on the CDR1H and CDR3H regions of a well-studied scFv antibody. Our data sheds light on the structural basis for antigen binding affinity, and suggests a dominant role for CDR1H in establishing antibody stability.

A common problem of the above techniques is the translation of the resulting data into relevant parameters, such as the typical division and death rate of the different lymphocyte populations. Theoretical immunology has contributed significantly to the interpretation of such quantitative experimental data, thereby resolving diverse controversies and, most importantly, has suggested novel experiments, allowing for more conclusive and quantitative interpretations.

TCR beta subunits can be unambiguously identified by their hypervariable CDR3 (Complement Determining Region 3) sequence. This is the site of V(D)J recombination encoding the principal site of antigen contact. The complexity and dynamics of the T-cell repertoire remain unknown because the potential repertoire size has made conventional sequence analysis intractable. Here, we use 5'-RACE, Illumina sequencing, and a novel short read assembly strategy to sample CDR3(beta) diversity in human T lymphocytes from peripheral blood. Assembly of 40.5 million short reads identified 33,664 distinct TCR(beta) clonotypes and provides precise measurements of CDR3(beta) length diversity, usage of nontemplated bases, sequence convergence, and preferences for TRBV (T-cell receptor beta variable gene) and TRBJ (T-cell receptor beta joining gene) gene usage and pairing. CDR3 length between conserved residues of TRBV and TRBJ ranged from 21 to 81 nucleotides (nt). TRBV gene usage ranged from 0.01{\%} for TRBV17 to 24.6{\%} for TRBV20-1. TRBJ gene usage ranged from 1.6{\%} for TRBJ2-6 to 17.2{\%} for TRBJ2-1.

Second, combining parabiosis, single-cell analyses, and gene knockouts, we uncover a multi-organ web of tissue-resident memory T cells that functionally adapt to their environment to stop viral spread across the organism. These results have implications for manipulating tissue-resident memory T cells through vaccination and open up new lines of inquiry for the analysis of immune responses at the organism level.

The abundance distribution is mapped onto the density of states, and the R$\backslash$'enyi entropy to the free energy. The two quantities are related in the thermodynamic limit by a Legendre transform, by virtue of the equivalence between the micro-canonical and canonical ensembles. In this limit, we show how the R$\backslash$'enyi entropy can be constructed geometrically from rank-frequency plots. This mapping predicts that non-concave regions of the rank-frequency curve should result in kinks in the R$\backslash$'enyi entropy as a function of its order. We illustrate our results on simple examples, and emphasize the limitations of the equivalence of ensembles when a thermodynamic limit is not well defined.

abstract = {Stochastic rearrangement of germline V-, D-, and J-genes to create variable coding sequence for certain cell surface receptors is at the origin of immune system diversity. This process, known as "VDJ recombination", is implemented via a series of stochastic molecular events involving gene choices and random nucleotide insertions between, and deletions from, genes. We use large sequence repertoires of the variable CDR3 region of human CD4+ T-cell receptor beta chains to infer the statistical properties of these basic biochemical events. Because any given CDR3 sequence can be produced in multiple ways, the probability distribution of hidden recombination events cannot be inferred directly from the observed sequences; we therefore develop a maximum likelihood inference method to achieve this end. To separate the properties of the molecular rearrangement mechanism from the effects of selection, we focus on nonproductive CDR3 sequences in T-cell DNA. We infer the joint distribution of the various generative events that occur when a new T-cell receptor gene is created. We find a rich picture of correlation (and absence thereof), providing insight into the molecular mechanisms involved. The generative event statistics are consistent between individuals, suggesting a universal biochemical process. Our probabilistic model predicts the generation probability of any specific CDR3 sequence by the primitive recombination process, allowing us to quantify the potential diversity of the T-cell repertoire and to understand why some sequences are shared between individuals. We argue that the use of formal statistical inference methods, of the kind presented in this paper, will be essential for quantitative understanding of the generation and evolution of diversity in the adaptive immune system.},

abstract = {Adaptive immunity in humans is provided by hypervariable Ig-like molecules on the surface of B and T cells. The final set of these molecules in each organism is formed under the influence of two forces: individual genetic traits and the environment, which includes the diverse spectra of alien and self-antigens. Here we assess the impact of individual genetic factors on the formation of the adaptive immunity by analyzing the T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoires of three pairs of monozygous twins by next-generation sequencing. Surprisingly, we found that an overlap between the TCR repertoires of monozygous twins is similar to an overlap between the TCR repertoires of nonrelated individuals. However, the number of identical complementary determining region 3 sequences in two individuals is significantly increased for twin pairs in the fraction of highly abundant TCR molecules, which is enriched by the antigen-experienced T cells. We found that the initial recruitment of particular TCR V genes for recombination and subsequent selection in the thymus is strictly determined by individual genetic factors. J genes of TCRs are selected randomly for recombination; however, the subsequent selection in the thymus gives preference to some but not {\{}beta{\}} J segments. These findings provide a deeper insight into the mechanism of TCR repertoire generation.},

We here present updated versions of two MHC-II-peptide binding affinity prediction methods, NetMHCII and NetMHCIIpan. These were constructed using an extended data set of quantitative MHC-peptide binding affinity data obtained from the Immune Epitope Database covering HLA-DR, HLA-DQ, HLA-DP and H-2 mouse molecules. We show that training with this extended data set improved the performance for peptide binding predictions for both methods.

abstract = {Due to homeostasis total naive T cell numbers remain fairly constant over life despite a gradual involution of the thymus. The contribution of the thymus to maintaining naive T cell pools is typically measured with TCR excision circles (TRECs) that are formed in thymocytes. The mechanisms underlying thymic involution are poorly understood. Some data suggest that thymocytes undergo fewer divisions in old (small) than young (large) thymi, and other data suggest that the number of TRECs per thymocyte is independent of age. If thymic involution were associated with a decreased number of divisions of the thymocytes, this would markedly complicate the interpretation of TREC data. To study this we develop a mathematical model in which the division rate of thymocytes decreases with increasing age. We describe the dilution of TRECs formed during the arrangement of both chains of the TCR by division of thymocytes, recent thymic emigrants, and mature naive T cells. The model behavior is complicated as TREC contents in naive T cells can increase with age due to decreased dilution in the thymus. Because our model is consistent with current data on the effects of age and thymectomy on TRECs in peripheral T cells, we conclude that aging may well affect thymocyte division, which markedly complicates the interpretation of TREC data. It is possible, but more difficult, to let the model be consistent with the rapid changes in alpha and beta TRECs observed shortly after HIV infection.},

By sequencing 2.8 million recombined heavy-chain genes from immature and mature B-cell subsets in mice, we demonstrate a striking gradient in VH gene use as pre-B cells mature into follicular and then into marginal zone B cells. Cells whose antibodies use VH genes that encode a more flexible elbow are more likely to mature. This effect is distinct from, and exceeds in magnitude, previously described maturation-associated changes in heavy-chain complementarity determining region 3, a key antigen-binding region, which arise from junctional diversity rather than differential VH gene use. Thus, deep sequencing reveals a previously unidentified mode of B-cell selection.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The clonal theory of adaptive immunity proposes that immunological responses are encoded by increases in the frequency of lymphocytes carrying antigen-specific receptors. In this study, we measure the frequency of different T-cell receptors (TcR) in CD4 + T cell populations of mice immunized with a complex antigen, killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis, using high throughput parallel sequencing of the TcR$\beta$ chain. Our initial hypothesis that immunization would induce repertoire convergence proved to be incorrect, and therefore an alternative approach was developed that allows accurate stratification of TcR repertoires and provides novel insights into the nature of CD4 + T-cell receptor recognition.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: To track the changes induced by immunization within this heterogeneous repertoire, the sequence data were classified by counting the frequency of different clusters of short (3 or 4) continuous stretches of amino acids within the antigen binding complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) repertoire of different mice. Both unsupervised (hierarchical clustering) and supervised (support vector machine) analyses of these different distributions of sequence clusters differentiated between immunized and unimmunized mice with 100{\%} efficiency. The CD4 + TcR repertoires of mice 5 and 14 days postimmunization were clearly different from that of unimmunized mice but were not distinguishable from each other. However, the repertoires of mice 60 days postimmunization were distinct both from naive mice and the day 5/14 animals. Our results reinforce the remarkable diversity of the TcR repertoire, resulting in many diverse private TcRs contributing to the T-cell response even in genetically identical mice responding to the same antigen. However, specific motifs defined by short stretches of amino acids within the CDR3 region may determine TcR specificity and define a new approach to TcR sequence classification.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The analysis was implemented in R and Python, and source code can be found in Supplementary Data.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONTACT: b.chain@ucl.ac.uk$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

abstract = {Purpose: To evaluate the immunomodulatory effects of cytotoxic T–lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA4) blockade with tremelimumab in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC).
Experimental Design: We used next-generation sequencing to study the complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) from the rearranged T-cell receptor (TCR) variable beta (V-beta) in PBMCs of 21 patients, at baseline and 30 to 60 days after receiving tremelimumab.
Results: After receiving tremelimumab, there was a median of 30{\%} increase in unique productive sequences of TCR V-beta CDR3 in 19 out of 21 patients, and a median decrease of 30{\%} in only 2 out of 21 patients. These changes were significant for richness (P = 0.01) and for Shannon index diversity (P = 0.04). In comparison, serially collected PBMCs from four healthy donors did not show a significant change in TCR V-beta CDR3 diversity over 1 year. There was a significant difference in the total unique productive TCR V-beta CDR3 sequences between patients experiencing toxicity with tremelimumab compared with patients without toxicity (P = 0.05). No relevant differences were noted between clinical responders and nonresponders.

abstract = {Summary Cell-mediated immunity stems from the proliferation of naive T lymphocytes expressing T cell antigen receptors (TCRs) specific for foreign peptides bound to host major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. Because of the tremendous diversity of the T cell repertoire, naive T cells specific for any one peptide:MHC complex (pMHC) are extremely rare. Thus, it is not known how many naive T cells of any given pMHC specificity exist in the body or how that number influences the immune response. By using soluble pMHC class {\{}II{\}} (pMHCII) tetramers and magnetic bead enrichment, we found that three different pMHCII-specific naive CD4+ T cell populations vary in frequency from 20 to 200 cells per mouse. Moreover, naive population size predicted the size and {\{}TCR{\}} diversity of the primary CD4+ T cell response after immunization with relevant peptide. Thus, variation in naive T cell frequencies can explain why some peptides are stronger immunogens than others. },

abstract = {Vaccines that elicit protective cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) may improve on or augment those designed primarily to elicit antibody responses. However, we have little basis for estimating the numbers of CTL required for sterilising immunity at an infection site. To address this we begin with a theoretical estimate obtained from measurements of CTL surveillance rates and the growth rate of a virus. We show how this estimate needs to be modified to account for (i) the dynamics of CTL-infected cell conjugates, and (ii) features of the virus lifecycle in infected cells. We show that provided the inoculum size of the virus is low, the dynamics of CTL-infected cell conjugates can be ignored, but knowledge of virus life-histories is required for estimating critical thresholds of CTL densities. We show that accounting for virus replication strategies increases estimates of the minimum density of CTL required for immunity over those obtained with the canonical model of virus dynamics, and demonstrate that this modeling framework allows us to predict and compare the ability of CTL to control viruses with different life history strategies. As an example we predict that lytic viruses are more difficult to control than budding viruses when net reproduction rates and infected cell lifetimes are controlled for. Further, we use data from acute SIV infection in rhesus macaques to calculate a lower bound on the density of CTL that a vaccine must generate to control infection at the entry site. We propose that critical CTL densities can be better estimated either using quantitative models incorporating virus life histories or with in vivo assays using virus-infected cells rather than peptide-pulsed targets.},

abstract = {In some epitope-specific responses, T cells bearing identical TCRs occur in many MHC-matched individuals. The sharing of public TCRs is unexpected, given the enormous potential diversity of the TCR repertoire. We have previously studied the sharing of TCR beta-chains in the CD8(+) T cell responses to two influenza epitopes in mice. Analysis of these TCRbeta repertoires suggests that, even with unbiased V(D)J recombination mechanisms, some TCRbetas can be produced more frequently than others, by a process of convergent recombination. The TCRbeta production frequency was shown to be a good predictor of the observed sharing of epitope-specific TCRbetas between mice. However, this study was limited to immune responses in an inbred population. In this study, we investigated TCRbeta sharing in CD8(+) T cell responses specific for the immunodominant Mamu-A*01-restricted Tat-SL8/TL8 and Gag-CM9 epitopes of SIV in rhesus macaques. Multiple data sets were used, comprising a total of approximately 6000 TCRbetas sampled from 20 macaques. We observed a spectrum in the number of macaques sharing epitope-specific TCRbetas in this outbred population. This spectrum of TCRbeta sharing was negatively correlated with the minimum number of nucleotide additions required to produce the sequences and strongly positively correlated with the number of observed nucleotide sequences encoding the amino acid sequences. We also found that TCRbeta sharing was correlated with the number of times, and the variety of different ways, the sequences were produced in silico via random gene recombination. Thus, convergent recombination is a major determinant of the extent of TCRbeta sharing.},

abstract = {The diversity of T-cell receptors recognizing foreign pathogens is generated through a highly stochastic recombination process, making the independent production of the same sequence rare. Yet unrelated individuals do share receptors, which together constitute a “public” repertoire of abundant clonotypes. The TCR repertoire is initially formed prenatally, when the enzyme inserting random nucleotides is downregulated, producing a limited diversity subset. By statistically analyzing deep sequencing T-cell repertoire data from twins, unrelated individuals of various ages, and cord blood, we show that T-cell clones generated before birth persist and maintain high abundances in adult organisms for decades, slowly decaying with age. Our results suggest that large, low-diversity public clones are created during pregnancy, and survive over long periods, providing the basis of the public repertoire.},

abstract = {Newborn human infants, particularly those born prematurely, are susceptible to infection with a variety of microorganisms. We questioned whether limitations in the T cell repertoire contribute to the neonatal immunocompromised state. To describe developmental changes of the T cell repertoire, cDNA segments corresponding to third complementarity regions (CDR3) of human umbilical cord blood T cell receptors (TCR) from 24-41-wk gestational age were amplified with TCR family-specific probes. The resulting amplified CDRs were visualized by fingerprinting and single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. At 24-wk gestation there were no limitations in TCRBV family usage, and the degree of CDR3 size heterogeneity was not different from the adult. However, earlier in gestation, CDR3s were shorter for all families and gradually increased in size until term. The extent of oligoclonal expansion observed in cord blood was greater than in adult peripheral blood (p = 0.03). T cell oligoclonal expansion was greatest at 29-33-wk gestation and declined toward term. Expansions were detectable in both CD4+ and CD8+ subpopulations. Our findings indicate that the genetic mechanisms of repertoire diversification appear intact as early as 24 wk of gestation, but repertoire diversity is limited as a result of smaller CDR3 sizes. In addition, there was a developmentally regulated progression of oligoclonally expanded T cells. These differences in the TCRBV repertoire add to the body of evidence demonstrating immaturity of the neonatal immune system. However, the role that these subtle differences are likely to play in the relative immunodeficiency of the neonate remains to be determined.},

While reliable predictions of peptide binding are available for most Major Histocompatibility Complex class I (MHCI) alleles, prediction models of T cell receptor (TCR) interactions with MHC class I-peptide complexes remain poor due to the limited amount of available training data. Recent next generation sequencing projects have however generated a considerable amount of data relating TCR sequences with their cognate HLA-peptide complex target. Here, we utilize such data to train a sequence-based predictor of the interaction between TCRs and peptides presented by the most common human MHCI allele, HLA-A*02:01. Our model is based on convolutional neural networks, which are especially designed to meet the challenges posed by the large length variations of TCRs. We show that such a sequence-based model allows for the identification of TCRs binding a given cognate peptide-MHC target out of a large pool of non-binding TCRs.},

abstract = {We develop a mathematical model for the self-renewing part of the T cell repertoire. Assuming that self-renewing T cells have to be stimulated by immunogenic MHC-peptide complexes presented on the surfaces of antigen-presenting cells, we derive a model of T cell growth in which competition for MHC-peptide complexes limits T cell clone sizes and regulates the total number of self-renewing T cells in the animal. We show that for a sufficient diversity and/or degree of cross-reactivity, the total T cell number hardly depends upon the diversity of the T cell repertoire or the diversity of the set of presented peptides. Conversely, for repertoires of lower diversity and/or cross-reactivity, steady-state total T cell numbers may be limited by the diversity of the T cells. This provides a possible explanation for the limited repertoire expansion in some, but not all, mouse T cell re-constitution experiments. We suggest that the competitive interactions described by our model underlie the normal T cells numbers observed in transgenic mice, germ-free mice and various knockout mice.},

We failed to identify any cross-reactions between the synthetic peptides in the panel and polyclonal CD8+ T cells raised to viral or alloantigens.

The length preferences vary depending on the MHC allele, but are generally limited to peptides of length 8-11 amino acids. On this relatively simple system, we developed a sequence alignment method based on artificial neural networks that allows insertions and deletions in the alignment. RESULTS We show that prediction methods based on alignments that include insertions and deletions have significantly higher performance than methods trained on peptides of single lengths. Also, we illustrate how the location of deletions can aid the interpretation of the modes of binding of the peptide-MHC, as in the case of long peptides bulging out of the MHC groove or protruding at either terminus. Finally, we demonstrate that the method can learn the length profile of different MHC molecules, and quantified the reduction of the experimental effort required to identify potential epitopes using our prediction algorithm.

Specifically, we describe work that brings together statistical mechanics and cell biology to shed light on how key molecular/cellular components of the adaptive immune system are selected to enable pathogen-specific responses.

The review begins by covering fundamental concepts in ML and modern statistics such as the bias-variance tradeoff, overfitting, regularization, and generalization before moving on to more advanced topics in both supervised and unsupervised learning. Topics covered in the review include ensemble models, deep learning and neural networks, clustering and data visualization, energy-based models (including MaxEnt models and Restricted Boltzmann Machines), and variational methods. Throughout, we emphasize the many natural connections between ML and statistical physics. A notable aspect of the review is the use of Python notebooks to introduce modern ML/statistical packages to readers using physics-inspired datasets (the Ising Model and Monte-Carlo simulations of supersymmetric decays of proton-proton collisions). We conclude with an extended outlook discussing possible uses of machine learning for furthering our understanding of the physical world as well as open problems in ML where physicists maybe able to contribute.

abstract = {VDJ rearrangement and somatic hypermutation work together to produce antibody-coding B cell receptor (BCR) sequences for a remarkable diversity of antigens. It is now possible to sequence these BCRs in high throughput; analysis of these sequences is bringing new insight into how antibodies develop, in particular for broadly-neutralizing antibodies against HIV and influenza. A fundamental step in such sequence analysis is to annotate each base as coming from a specific one of the V, D, or J genes, or from an N-addition (a.k.a. non-templated insertion). Previous work has used simple parametric distributions to model transitions from state to state in a hidden Markov model (HMM) of VDJ recombination, and assumed that mutations occur via the same process across sites. However, codon frame and other effects have been observed to violate these parametric assumptions for such coding sequences, suggesting that a non-parametric approach to modeling the recombination process could be useful. In our paper, we find that indeed large modern data sets suggest a model using parameter-rich per-allele categorical distributions for HMM transition probabilities and per-allele-per-position mutation probabilities, and that using such a model for inference leads to significantly improved results. We present an accurate and efficient BCR sequence annotation software package using a novel HMM "factorization" strategy. This package, called partis (https://github.com/psathyrella/partis/), is built on a new general-purpose HMM compiler that can perform efficient inference given a simple text description of an HMM.},

abstract = {Networks of living neurons exhibit diverse patterns of activity, including oscillations, synchrony, and waves. Recent work in physics has shown yet another mode of activity in systems composed of many nonlinear units interacting locally. For example, avalanches, earthquakes, and forest fires all propagate in systems organized into a critical state in which event sizes show no characteristic scale and are described by power laws. We hypothesized that a similar mode of activity with complex emergent properties could exist in networks of cortical neurons. We investigated this issue in mature organotypic cultures and acute slices of rat cortex by recording spontaneous local field potentials continuously using a 60 channel multielectrode array. Here, we show that propagation of spontaneous activity in cortical networks is described by equations that govern avalanches. As predicted by theory for a critical branching process, the propagation obeys a power law with an exponent of -3/2 for event sizes, with a branching parameter close to the critical value of 1. Simulations show that a branching parameter at this value optimizes information transmission in feedforward networks, while preventing runaway network excitation. Our findings suggest that "neuronal avalanches" may be a generic property of cortical networks, and represent a mode of activity that differs profoundly from oscillatory, synchronized, or wave-like network states. In the critical state, the network may satisfy the competing demands of information transmission and network stability.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: High-throughput sequencing (HTS) of immunoglobulin heavy-chain genes (IGH) in unselected clinical samples for minimal residual disease (MRD) in B lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) has not been tested. As current MRD-detecting methods such as flow cytometry or patient-specific qPCR are complex or difficult to standardize in the clinical laboratory, sequencing may enhance clinical prognostication.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We sequenced IGH in paired pretreatment and day 29 post-treatment samples using residual material from consecutive, unselected samples from the Children's Oncology Group AALL0932 trial to measure MRD as compared with flow cytometry. We assessed the impact of ongoing recombination at IGH on MRD detection in post-treatment samples. Finally, we evaluated a subset of cases with discordant MRD results between flow cytometry and sequencing.

RESULTS: We found clonal IGH rearrangements in 92 of 98 pretreatment patient samples. Furthermore, while ongoing recombination of IGH was evident, index clones typically prevailed in MRD-positive post-treatment samples, suggesting that clonal evolution at IGH does not contribute substantively to tumor fitness. MRD was detected by sequencing in all flow cytometry-positive cases with no false-negative results. In addition, in a subset of patients, MRD was detected by sequencing, but not by flow cytometry, including a fraction with MRD levels within the sensitivity of flow cytometry. We provide data that suggest that this discordance in some patients may be due to the phenotypic maturation of the transformed cell.

CONCLUSION: Our results provide strong support for HTS of IGH to enhance clinical prognostication in B-ALL.},

abstract = {The advent of cancer immunotherapy has generated renewed hope for the treatment of many malignancies by introducing a number of novel strategies that exploit various properties of the immune system. These therapies are based on the idea that cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) directly recognize and respond to tumor-associated neoantigens (TANs) in much the same way as they would to foreign peptides presented on cell surfaces. To date, however, nearly all attempts to optimize immunotherapeutic strategies have been empirical. Here, we develop a model of T cell selection based on the assumption of random interaction strengths between a self-peptide and the various T cell receptors. The model enables the analytical study of the effects of selection on the CTL recognition of TANs and completely foreign peptides and can estimate the number of CTLs that can detect donor-matched transplants. We show that negative selection thresholds chosen to reflect experimentally observed thymic survival rates result in near-optimal production of T cells that are capable of surviving selection and recognizing foreign antigen. These analytical results are confirmed by simulation.},

However, the nature and extent of TCR cross-reactivity has not been conclusively measured experimentally. We developed a system to identify MHC-presented peptide ligands by combining TCR selection of highly diverse yeast-displayed peptide-MHC libraries with deep sequencing. Although we identified hundreds of peptides reactive with each of five different mouse and human TCRs, the selected peptides possessed TCR recognition motifs that bore a close resemblance to their known antigens. This structural conservation of the TCR interaction surface allowed us to exploit deep-sequencing information to computationally identify activating microbial and self-ligands for human autoimmune TCRs. The mechanistic basis of TCR cross-reactivity described here enables effective surveillance of diverse self and foreign antigens without necessitating degenerate recognition of nonhomologous peptides. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {In some epitope-specific responses, T cells bearing identical TCRs occur in many MHC-matched individuals. The sharing of public TCRs is unexpected, given the enormous potential diversity of the TCR repertoire. We have previously studied the sharing of TCR beta-chains in the CD8(+) T cell responses to two influenza epitopes in mice. Analysis of these TCRbeta repertoires suggests that, even with unbiased V(D)J recombination mechanisms, some TCRbetas can be produced more frequently than others, by a process of convergent recombination. The TCRbeta production frequency was shown to be a good predictor of the observed sharing of epitope-specific TCRbetas between mice. However, this study was limited to immune responses in an inbred population. In this study, we investigated TCRbeta sharing in CD8(+) T cell responses specific for the immunodominant Mamu-A*01-restricted Tat-SL8/TL8 and Gag-CM9 epitopes of SIV in rhesus macaques. Multiple data sets were used, comprising a total of approximately 6000 TCRbetas sampled from 20 macaques. We observed a spectrum in the number of macaques sharing epitope-specific TCRbetas in this outbred population. This spectrum of TCRbeta sharing was negatively correlated with the minimum number of nucleotide additions required to produce the sequences and strongly positively correlated with the number of observed nucleotide sequences encoding the amino acid sequences. We also found that TCRbeta sharing was correlated with the number of times, and the variety of different ways, the sequences were produced in silico via random gene recombination. Thus, convergent recombination is a major determinant of the extent of TCRbeta sharing.},

abstract = {The variational principles called maximum entropy (MaxEnt) and maximum caliber (MaxCal) are reviewed. MaxEnt originated in the statistical physics of Boltzmann and Gibbs, as a theoretical tool for predicting the equilibrium states of thermal systems. Later, entropy maximization was also applied to matters of information, signal transmission, and image reconstruction. Recently, since the work of Shore and Johnson, MaxEnt has been regarded as a principle that is broader than either physics or information alone. MaxEnt is a procedure that ensures that inferences drawn from stochastic data satisfy basic self-consistency requirements. The different historical justifications for the entropy S=-∑ipilog⁡pi and its corresponding variational principles are reviewed. As an illustration of the broadening purview of maximum entropy principles, maximum caliber, which is path entropy maximization applied to the trajectories of dynamical systems, is also reviewed. Examples are given in which maximum caliber is used to interpret dynamical fluctuations in biology and on the nanoscale, in single-molecule and few-particle systems such as molecular motors, chemical reactions, biological feedback circuits, and diffusion in microfluidics devices.},

abstract = {The affinities of anti-2,4-dinitrophenyl (DNP) antibodies for a variety of 2,4-dinitrobenzenes have been measured by fluorescence quenching and the values obtained have been verified in representative instances by equilibrium dialysis. All populations of anti-DNP molecules examined, whether isolated from pooled sera or from single bleedings of individual rabbits, were heterogeneous in respect to affinity for dinitrobenzenes. The heterogeneity in virtually every instance could be described by the Sips distribution function over a wide range of binding data, and each titration was thus characterized by an average intrinsic association constant (KO), and by a heterogeneity index (a). Fractional precipitation of antibodies from serum, by addition of limiting amounts of antigen, yielded from the serum of individual rabbits anti-DNP populations that differed as much as 10,000-fold in KO. Changes in affinity for e-DNP-lysine were followed by isolating antibodies from sera at various times after a single injection of DNP- bovine-gamma-globulin. The KO increased progressively with time after immunization and the rate of increase was most conspicuous when small quantities of DNP-bovine-gamma-globulin were injected initially. The rise in KO was markedly delayed when large doses of antigen were injected. Antibody populations isolated early after immunization had nearly the same low affinity for both e-DNP-L-lysine and for 2,4-dinitroaniline, and it is inferred that their specific binding sites are poorly adapted to the dinitroanilino group and insensitive to the norleucine moiety of e-DNP- lysine. In contrast, antibodies isolated late after immunization bind e-DNP-lysine strongly, and from their interactions with a variety of dinitrobenzenes it is inferred that their binding sites, on the average, are just about large enough to accommodate e-DNP-L-lysine. Complex formation was enthalpy driven: deltaH values ranged from -8 to -20 kcal mole{\^{}}-1 for different antibody-ligand pairs, and entropy values ranged from -5 to -30 entropy units mole{\^{}}-1. When representative 2,4-dinitrobenzenes were bound by anti-DNP molecules, bathychromic and hypochromic spectral shifts were observed; in the case of antibody-bound 2,4-dinitrotoluene a new absorption peak appeared at 300 mmu. The possibility is raised that charge-transfer contributes to the stability of antibody-dinitrophenyl complexes.},

To identify patterns that could be used for sequence-based monitoring of the antibody response to dengue, we examined antibody heavy-chain gene rearrangements in longitudinal peripheral blood samples from 60 dengue patients. Comparing signatures between acute dengue, postrecovery, and healthy samples, we found increased expansion of B cell clones in acute dengue patients, with higher overall clonality in secondary infection. Additionally, we observed consistent antibody sequence features in acute dengue in the highly variable major antigen-binding determinant, complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3), with specific CDR3 sequences highly enriched in acute samples compared to postrecovery, healthy, or non-dengue samples. Dengue thus provides a striking example of a human viral infection where convergent immune signatures can be identified in multiple individuals.

We show that the anti-inflammatory IL-10 signaling is long ranged, as opposed to the short-ranged pro-inflammatory TNF{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} signaling.

abstract = {In sexual population, recombination reshuffles genetic variation and produces novel combinations of existing alleles, while selection amplifies the fittest genotypes in the population. If recombination is more rapid than selection, populations consist of a diverse mixture of many genotypes, as is observed in many populations. In the opposite regime, which is realized for example in the facultatively sexual populations that outcross in only a fraction of reproductive cycles, selection can amplify individual genotypes into large clones. Such clones emerge when the fitness advantage of some of the genotypes is large enough that they grow to a significant fraction of the population despite being broken down by recombination. The occurrence of this ‘clonal condensation' depends, in addition to the outcrossing rate, on the heritability of fitness. Clonal condensation leads to a strong genetic heterogeneity of the population which is not adequately described by traditional population genetics measures, such as linkage disequilibrium. Here we point out the similarity between clonal condensation and the freezing transition in the random energy model of spin glasses. Guided by this analogy we explicitly calculate the probability, Y, that two individuals are genetically identical as a function of the key parameters of the model. While Y is the analog of the spin-glass order parameter, it is also closely related to rate of coalescence in population genetics: two individuals that are part of the same clone have a recent common ancestor.},

We reassessed homeostasis and dynamics of T cells 1) by generating a mathematical model describing the spatiotemporal features of T cell differentiation, and 2) by fitting this model to experimental data generated by disturbing T cell differentiation through transient depletion of dividing T cells in mice. This specific depletion was obtained by administration of ganciclovir to mice expressing the conditional thymidine kinase suicide gene in T cells. With this experimental approach, we could derive quantitative parameters describing the cell fluxes, residence times, and rates of import, export, proliferation, and death across cell compartments for thymocytes and recent thymic emigrants (RTEs). Among other parameters, we show that 93{\%} of thymocytes produced before single-positive stages are eliminated through the selection process. Then, a postselection peripheral expansion of naive T cells contributes three times more to naive T cell production than the thymus, with half of the naive T cells consisting of dividing RTEs. Altogether, this work provides a quantitative population dynamical framework of thymocyte development, RTEs, and naive T cells.},

abstract = { Lifelong interactions between host and the ubiquitous and persistent cytomegalovirus (CMV) have been proposed to contribute to the age-related decline in immunity. Prior work from us and others found some support for that idea, yet evidence that this led to increased vulnerability to other infections was not obtained. Moreover, evidence has accumulated that CMV infection can be beneficial to immune defense in young/adult mice and humans, dominantly via enhanced innate immunity. Here, we describe an unexpected impact of murine CMV (MCMV) upon the T cell response of old mice to Listeria monocytogenes expressing the model antigen, OVA (Lm-OVA). Single-cell sequencing of the OVA-specific CD8 T cell receptor $\beta$ (TCR$\beta$) repertoire of old mice demonstrated that old MCMV-infected mice recruited many diverse clonotypes that afforded broad and often more efficient recognition of antigenic peptide variants. This stood in contrast to old control mice, which exhibited strong narrowing and homogenization of the elicited repertoire. High-throughput sequencing of the total na{\"{i}}ve CD8 TCR$\beta$ repertoire showed that many of these diverse OVA-specific clonotypes were present in the na{\"{i}}ve CD8 repertoire of mice in all groups (adult, old control, and old MCMV + ) yet were only recruited into the Lm-OVA response in MCMV + old mice. These results have profound implications for our understanding of T cell immunity over a life span and suggest that our coevolution with CMV may include surprising, potentially positive impacts on adaptive heterologous immunity in late life. },

abstract = {Binding of the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) to peptides presented on molecules encoded by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes is the key event driving T cell development and activation. Selection of the T cell repertoire in the thymus involves two steps. First, positive selection promotes the survival of cells binding thymic self-MHC-peptide complexes with sufficient affinity. The resulting repertoire is self-MHC restricted: it recognizes foreign peptides presented on self, but not foreign MHC. Second, negative selection deletes cells which may be potentially harmful because their receptors interact with self-MHC-peptide complexes with too high an affinity. The mature repertoire is also highly alloreactive: a large fraction of T cells respond to tissues harboring foreign MHC. We derive mathematical expressions giving the frequency of alloreactivity, the level of self-MHC restriction, and the fraction of the repertoire activated by a foreign peptide, as a function of the parameters driving the generation and selection of the repertoire: self-MHC and self-peptide diversity, the stringencies of positive and negative selection, and the number of peptide and MHC polymorphic residues that contribute to T cell receptor binding. Although the model is based on a simplified digit string representation of receptors, all the parameters but one relate directly to experimentally determined quantities. The only parameter without a biological counterpart has no effect on the model's behavior besides a trivial and easily preventable discretization effect. We further analyse the role of the MHC and peptide contribution to TCR binding, and find that their relative, rather than absolute value, is important in shaping the mature repertoire. This result makes it possible to adopt different physical interpretations for the digit string formalism. We also find that the alloreactivity level can be inferred directly from data on the stringency of selection, and that, in agreement with recent experiments, it is not affected by thymic selection.},

abstract = {The deterioration in immune function with aging is thought to make a major contribution to the increased morbidity and mortality from infectious disease in old age. One aspect of immune senescence is the reduction in CD8 T cell repertoire as due to the accumulation of oligoclonal, memory T cells and a reduction in the naive T cell pool. CD8 T cell clonal expansions accumulate with age, but their antigenic specificity remains unknown. In this study, we show that in elderly individuals seropositivity for human CMV leads to the development of oligoclonal populations of CMV-specific CTL that can constitute up to one-quarter of the total CD8 T cell population. Furthermore, CMV-specific CTL have a highly polarized membrane phenotype that is typical of effector memory cells (CD28(-), CD57(+), CCR7(-)). TCR analyses show that CMV-specific CTL have highly restricted clonality with greater restriction in the larger expansions. Clonal analysis of the total CD8 T cell repertoire was compared between CMV-seropositive and CMV-seronegative donors. Thirty-three percent more clonal expansions were observed in CMV-seropositive donors in comparison with seronegative individuals. These data implicate CMV as a major factor in driving oligoclonal expansions in old age. Such a dramatic accumulation of virus-specific effector CTL might impair the ability to respond to heterologous infection and may underlie the negative influence of CMV seropositivity on survival in the very elderly.},

abstract = {The initiation of T cell responses in lymph nodes requires T cells to integrate signals delivered by dendritic cells (DCs) during long-lasting contacts (synapses) or more transient interactions (kinapses). However, it remains extremely challenging to understand how a specific sequence of contacts established by T cells ultimately dictates T cell fate. Here, we have coupled a computational model of T cell migration and interactions with DCs with a real-time, flow cytometry-like representation of T cell activation. In this model, low affinity peptides trigger T cell proliferation through kinapses but we show that this process is only effective under conditions of high DC densities and prolonged antigen availability. By contrast, high affinity peptides favor synapse formation and a vigorous proliferation under a wide range of antigen presentation conditions. In line with the predictions, decreasing the DC density in vivo selectively abolished proliferation induced by the low affinity peptide. Finally, our results suggest that T cells possess a biochemical memory of previous stimulations of at least 1-2 days. We propose that the stability of T cell-DC interactions, apart from their signaling potency, profoundly influences the robustness of T cell activation. By offering the ability to control parameters that are difficult to manipulate experimentally, the virtual lymph node model provides new possibilities to tackle the fundamental mechanisms that regulate T cell responses elicited by infections or vaccines.Immunology and Cell Biology accepted article preview online, 19 April 2016. doi:10.1038/icb.2016.36.},

abstract = {Statistical methods based on the relative frequency of replacement mutations in B lymphocyte Ig V region sequences have been widely used to detect the forces of selection that shape the B cell repertoire. However, current methods produce an unexpectedly high frequency of false positives and are sensitive to intrinsic biases of somatic hypermutation that can give the appearance of selection. The new statistical test proposed here provides a better trade-off between sensitivity and specificity compared with previous approaches. The low specificity of existing methods was shown in silico to result from an interaction between the effects of positive and negative selection. False detection of positive selection was confirmed in vivo through a re-analysis of published sequence data from diffuse large B cell lymphomas, highlighting the need for re-analysis of some existing studies. The sensitivity of the proposed method to detect selection was validated using new Ig transgenic mouse models in which positive selection was expected to be a significant force, as well as with a simulation-based approach. Previous concerns that intrinsic biases of somatic hypermutation could give the appearance of selection were addressed by extending the current mutation models to more fully account for the impact of microsequence on relative mutability and to include transition bias. High specificity was confirmed using a large set of non-productively rearranged Ig sequences. These results show that selection can be detected in vivo with high specificity using the new method proposed here, allowing greater insight into the existence and direction of antigen-driven selection.},

abstract = {The mean distribution of lengths in the third complementarity-determining region of the heavy chain (HCDR3) serves as a measure of the development of the antibody repertoire during ontogeny. To determine the timing and pattern of HCDR3 length maturation during the third trimester of pregnancy, the mean distribution of HCDR3 lengths among variable-diversity-joining-constant-mu (VDJCmu) transcripts from the cord blood was analyzed from 138 infants of 23 to 40 weeks' gestation, including 3 sets of twins, 2 of which were of dizygotic origin. HCDR3 maturation begins at the start of the third trimester; follows a slow, continuous expansion over a 5-month period; and is unaffected by race or sex. The range and mean distribution of lengths may vary in dizygotic twins, indicating individual rates of development. The mean HCDR3 length distribution in 10 premature infants with documented bacterial sepsis was then followed for 2 to 12 weeks after their first positive blood culture. HCDR3 spectrotype analysis demonstrated oligoclonal B-cell activation and expansion after sepsis, but maturation of the repertoire was not accelerated even by the systemic exposure to external antigen represented by bacteremia. Antibody repertoire development appears to be endogenously controlled and adheres to an individualized developmental progression that probably contributes to the relative immaturity of the neonatal immune response. {\textcopyright} 2001 by The American Society of Hematology.},

@article{Rempala2011a,
abstract = {In modern molecular biology one of the standard ways of analyzing a vertebrate immune system is to sequence and compare the counts of specific antigen receptor clones (either immunoglobulins or T-cell receptors) derived from various tissues under different experimental or clinical conditions. The resulting statistical challenges are difficult and do not fit readily into the standard statistical framework of contingency tables primarily due to the serious under-sampling of the receptor populations. This under-sampling is caused, on one hand, by the extreme diversity of antigen receptor repertoires maintained by the immune system and, on the other, by the high cost and labor intensity of the receptor data collection process. In most of the recent immunological literature the differences across antigen receptor populations are examined via non-parametric statistical measures of the species overlap and diversity borrowed from ecological studies. While this approach is robust in a wide range of situations, it seems to provide little insight into the underlying clonal size distribution and the overall mechanism differentiating the receptor populations. As a possible alternative, the current paper presents a parametric method that adjusts for the data under-sampling as well as provides a unifying approach to a simultaneous comparison of multiple receptor groups by means of the modern statistical tools of unsupervised learning. The parametric model is based on a flexible multivariate Poisson-lognormal distribution and is seen to be a natural generalization of the univariate Poisson-lognormal models used in the ecological studies of biodiversity patterns. The procedure for evaluating a model's fit is described along with the public domain software developed to perform the necessary diagnostics. The model-driven analysis is seen to compare favorably vis a vis traditional methods when applied to the data from T-cell receptors in transgenic mice populations.},

abstract = {CD8(+) T cells directed against beta cell autoantigens are considered relevant for the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes. Using single cell T cell receptor sequencing of CD8(+) T cells specific for the IGRP265-273 epitope, we examined whether there was expansion of clonotypes and sharing of T cell receptor chains in autoreactive CD8(+) T cell repertoires. HLA-A*0201 positive type 1 diabetes patients (n = 19) and controls (n = 18) were analysed. TCR $\alpha$- and $\beta$-chain sequences of 418 patient-derived IGRP265-273-multimer(+) CD8(+) T cells representing 48 clonotypes were obtained. Expanded populations of IGRP265-273-specific CD8(+) T cells with dominant clonotypes that had TCR $\alpha$-chains shared across patients were observed. The SGGSNYKLTF motif corresponding to TRAJ53 was contained in 384 (91.9{\%}) cells, and in 20 (41.7{\%}) patient-derived clonotypes. TRAJ53 together with TRAV29/DV5 was found in 15 (31.3{\%}) clonotypes. Using next generation TCR $\alpha$-chain sequencing, we found enrichment of one of these TCR $\alpha$-chains in the memory CD8(+) T cells of patients as compared to healthy controls. CD8(+) T cell clones bearing the enriched motifs mediated antigen-specific target cell lysis. We provide the first evidence for restriction of T cell receptor motifs in the alpha chain of human CD8(+) T cells with specificity to a beta cell antigen.},

abstract = {SUMMARY: High throughput sequencing provides an opportunity to analyse the repertoire of antigen specific receptors with an unprecedented breadth and depth. However, the quantity of raw data produced by this technology requires efficient ways to categorise and store the output for subsequent analysis. To this end, we have defined a simple five item identifier which uniquely and unambiguously defines each TcR sequence. We then describe a novel application of finite state automaton to map Illumina short read sequence data for individual TcRs to their respective identifier. An extension of the standard algorithm is also described, which allows for the presence of single base pair mismatches arising from sequencing error. The software package, named Decombinator, is tested first on a set of artificial in silico sequences and then on a set of published human TcR $\beta$ sequences. Decombinator assigned sequences at a rate more than two orders of magnitude faster than that achieved by classical pairwise alignment algorithms, and with a high degree of accuracy ({\textgreater} 88{\%}), even after introducing up to 1{\%} error rates in the in silico sequences. Analysis of the published sequence data set highlighted the strong V and J usage bias observed in the human peripheral blood repertoire, which appears to be unconnected to antigen exposure. The analysis also highlighted the enormous size of the available repertoire, and the challenge of obtaining a comprehensive description of it. The Decombinator package will be a valuable tool for further in depth analysis of the T cell repertoire.Availability and Implementation: The Decombinator package is implemented in Python (v2.6) and is freely available at https://github.com/uclinfectionimmunity/Decombinator along with full documentation and examples of typical usage.

abstract = {Diversity and size of the antigen-specific T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire are two critical determinants for successful control of chronic infection. Varicella zoster virus (VZV) that establishes latency during childhood can escape control mechanisms, in particular with increasing age. We examined the TCR diversity of VZV-reactive CD4 T cells in individuals older than 50 years by studying three identical twin pairs and three unrelated individuals before and after vaccination with live attenuated VZV. Although all individuals had a small number of dominant T cell clones, the breadth of the VZV-specific repertoire differed markedly. A genetic influence was seen for the sharing of individual TCR sequences from antigen-reactive cells but not for repertoire richness or the selection of dominant clones. VZV vaccination favored the expansion of infrequent VZV antigen-reactive TCRs, including those from na{\"{i}}ve T cells with lesser boosting of dominant T cell clones. Thus, vaccination does not reinforce the in vivo selection that occurred during chronic infection but leads to a diversification of the VZV-reactive T cell repertoire. However, a single-booster immunization seems insufficient to establish new clonal dominance. Our results suggest that repertoire analysis of antigen-specific TCRs can be an important readout to assess whether a vaccination was able to generate memory cells in clonal sizes that are necessary for immune protection.},

However, efforts to characterize B cell and T cell receptor (TCR) profiles in T1D subjects have been largely limited to peripheral blood sampling and restricted to known antigens. To address this, we collected pancreatic draining lymph nodes (pLN), "irrelevant" nonpancreatic draining lymph nodes, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and splenocytes from T1D subjects (n = 18) and control donors (n = 9) as well as pancreatic islets from 1 T1D patient; from these tissues, we collected purified CD4(+) conventional T cells (Tconv), CD4(+) Treg, CD8(+) T cells, and B cells. By conducting high-throughput immunosequencing of the TCR $\beta$ chain (TRB) and B cell receptor (BCR) immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) on these samples, we sought to analyze the molecular signature of the lymphocyte populations within these tissues and of T1D. Ultimately, we observed a highly tissue-restricted CD4(+) repertoire, while up to 24{\%} of CD8(+) clones were shared among tissues. We surveyed our data set for previously described proinsulin- and glutamic acid decarboxylase 65-reactive (GAD65-reactive) receptors, and interestingly, we observed a TRB with homology to a known GAD65-reactive TCR (clone GAD4.13) present in 7 T1D donors (38.9{\%}), representing {\textgreater}25{\%} of all productive TRB within Tconv isolated from the pLN of 1 T1D subject. These data demonstrate diverse receptor signatures at the nucleotide level and enriched autoreactive clones at the amino acid level, supporting the utility of coupling immunosequencing data with knowledge of characterized autoreactive receptors.},

abstract = {Measures of allele and haplotype diversity, which are fundamental properties in population genetics, often follow heavy tailed distributions. These measures are of particular interest in the field of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Donor/Recipient suitability for HSCT is determined by Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) similarity. Match predictions rely upon a precise description of HLA diversity, yet classical estimates are inaccurate given the heavy-tailed nature of the distribution. This directly affects HSCT matching and diversity measures in broader fields such as species richness. We, therefore, have developed a power-law based estimator to measure allele and haplotype diversity that accommodates heavy tails using the concepts of regular variation and occupancy distributions. Application of our estimator to 6.59 million donors in the Be The Match Registry revealed that haplotypes follow a heavy tail distribution across all ethnicities: for example, 44.65{\%} of the European American haplotypes are represented by only 1 individual. Indeed, our discovery rate of all U.S. European American haplotypes is estimated at 23.45{\%} based upon sampling 3.97{\%} of the population, leaving a large number of unobserved haplotypes. Population coverage, however, is much higher at 99.4{\%} given that 90{\%} of European Americans carry one of the 4.5{\%} most frequent haplotypes. Alleles were found to be less diverse suggesting the current registry represents most alleles in the population. Thus, for HSCT registries, haplotype discovery will remain high with continued recruitment to a very deep level of sampling, but population coverage will not. Finally, we compared the convergence of our power-law versus classical diversity estimators such as Capture recapture, Chao, ACE and Jackknife methods. When fit to the haplotype data, our estimator displayed favorable properties in terms of convergence (with respect to sampling depth) and accuracy (with respect to diversity estimates). This suggests that power-law based estimators offer a valid alternative to classical diversity estimators and may have broad applicability in the field of population genetics.},

abstract = {The primary immune response of BALB/c mice to influenza (PR8) hemagglutinin (HA), a complex protein antigen, has been examined by the splenic focus assay, and the resulting monoclonal anti-HA antibodies have been characterized by their reactivity with heterologous viruses. The analysis of the primary B-cell response to HA revealed marked differences from responses previously defined for haptenic determinants. There were following differences: (a) the frequency of HA-specific B cells in both conventional and germ-free BALB/c mice was 1 in 1.0-1.5 X 10(5) splenic B cells, which is substantially lower than the frequency of B cells responsive to various simple haptenic determinants; (b) monoclonal anti-HA antibodies were predominantly of the IgA or IgM isotypes instead of IgG, which dominates antihapten responses; and (c) after immunization, the frequency of anti-HA-specific B cells increases by 10- to 50-fold, which is much greater increase than that observed after immunization with haptenic determinants. Fine specificity analysis of primary monoclonal HA-specific antibodies revealed extensive diversity and a considerable overlap with the specificities obtained from immune mice. Given the low overall frequency of HA-specific B cells, it could be calculated that the representation of most HA-specific clonotypes within the B-cell repertoire could not exceed 1 in 10(7) B cells. These findings indicate that the primary B-cell clonotype repertoire is extremely diverse and largely antigen independent in its generation.},

In this study, we combine DNA barcoding with HTS to quantify PCR output from individual target molecules. We develop computational tools that simulate both the PCR branching process itself, and the subsequent subsampling which typically occurs during HTS sequencing. We explore the influence of different types of heterogeneity on sequencing output, and compare them to experimental results where the efficiency of amplification is measured by barcodes uniquely identifying each molecule of starting template. Our results demonstrate that the PCR process introduces substantial amplification heterogeneity, independent of primer sequence and bulk experimental conditions. This heterogeneity can be attributed both to inherited differences between different template DNA molecules, and the inherent stochasticity of the PCR process. The results demonstrate that PCR heterogeneity arises even when reaction and substrate conditions are kept as constant as possible, and therefore single molecule barcoding is essential in order to derive reproducible quantitative results from any protocol combining PCR with HTS.},

abstract = {To ward off a wide variety of pathogens, the human adaptive immune system harbors a vast array of T-cell receptors (TCRs) and B-cell receptors (BCRs), collectively referred to as the immune repertoire. High-throughput sequencing (HTS) of TCR/BCR genes allows in-depth molecular analysis of T/B-cell clones, providing an unprecedented level of detail when examining the T/B-cell repertoire of individuals. It can evaluate TCR/BCR complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) diversity and assess the clonal composition, including the size of the repertoire; similarities between repertoires; V(D)J segment use; nucleotide insertions and deletions; CDR3 lengths; and amino acid distributions along the CDR3s at sequence-level resolution. Deep sequencing of B-cell and T-cell repertoires offers the potential for a quantitative understanding of the adaptive immune system in healthy and disease states. Recently, paired sequencing strategies have also been developed, which can provide information about the identity of immune receptor pairs encoded by individual T or B lymphocytes. HTS technology provides a previously unimaginable amount of sequence data, accompanied, however, by numerous challenges associated with error correction and interpretation that remain to be solved. The review details some of the technologies and some of the recent achievements in this field.},

abstract = {The human naive T cell repertoire is the repository of a vast array of TCRs. However, the factors that shape their hierarchical distribution and relationship with the memory repertoire remain poorly understood. In this study, we used polychromatic flow cytometry to isolate highly pure memory and naive CD8(+) T cells, stringently defined with multiple phenotypic markers, and used deep sequencing to characterize corresponding portions of their respective TCR repertoires from four individuals. The extent of interindividual TCR sharing and the overlap between the memory and naive compartments within individuals were determined by TCR clonotype frequencies, such that higher-frequency clonotypes were more commonly shared between compartments and individuals. TCR clonotype frequencies were, in turn, predicted by the efficiency of their production during V(D)J recombination. Thus, convergent recombination shapes the TCR repertoire of the memory and naive T cell pools, as well as their interrelationship within and between individuals.},

abstract = {The study of genomic regions that contain gene copies and structural variation is a major challenge in modern genomics. Unlike variation involving single nucleotide changes, data on the variation of copy number is difficult to collect and few tools exist for analyzing the variation between individuals. The immunoglobulin heavy variable (IGHV) locus, which plays an integral role in the adaptive immune response, is an example of a complex genomic region that varies in gene copy number. Lack of standard methods to genotype this region prevents it from being included in association studies and is holding back the growing field of antibody repertoire analysis. Here we develop a method that takes short reads from high-throughput sequencing and outputs a genetic profile of the IGHV locus with the read coverage depth and a putative nucleotide sequence for each operationally defined gene cluster. Our operationally defined gene clusters aim to address a major challenge in studying the IGHV locus: the high sequence similarity between gene segments in different genomic locations. Tests on simulated data demonstrate that our approach can accurately determine the presence or absence of a gene cluster from reads as short as 70 bp. More detailed resolution on the copy number of gene clusters can be obtained from read coverage depth using longer reads (e.g., ≥ 100 bp). Detail at the nucleotide resolution of single copy genes (genes present in one copy per haplotype) can be determined with 250 bp reads. For IGHV genes with more than one copy, accurate nucleotide-resolution reconstruction is currently beyond the means of our approach. When applied to a family of European ancestry, our pipeline outputs genotypes that are consistent with the family pedigree, confirms existing multigene variants and suggests new copy number variants. This study paves the way for analyzing population-level patterns of variation in IGHV gene clusters in larger diverse datasets and for quantitatively handling regions of copy number variation in other structurally varying and complex loci.},

It has not been established whether individuals possess unique (or private) repertoires or substantial components of shared (or public) repertoires. Here we sequence recombined and expressed B cell receptor genes in several individuals to determine the size of their B cell receptor repertoires, and the extent to which these are shared between individuals. Our experiments revealed that the circulating repertoire of each individual contained between 9 and 17 million B cell clonotypes. The three individuals that we studied shared many clonotypes, including between 1 and 6{\%} of B cell heavy-chain clonotypes shared between two subjects (0.3{\%} of clonotypes shared by all three) and 20 to 34{\%} of $\lambda$ or $\kappa$ light chains shared between two subjects (16 or 22{\%} of $\lambda$ or $\kappa$ light chains, respectively, were shared by all three). Some of the B cell clonotypes had thousands of clones, or somatic variants, within the clonotype lineage. Although some of these shared lineages might be driven by exposure to common antigens, previous exposure to foreign antigens was not the only force that shaped the shared repertoires, as we also identified shared clonotypes in umbilical cord blood samples and all adult repertoires. The unexpectedly high prevalence of shared clonotypes in B cell repertoires, and identification of the sequences of these shared clonotypes, should enable better understanding of the role of B cell immune repertoires in health and disease.},

Here, we examine this problem at a molecular level in the context of populations of partially randomized proteins selected for binding to well-defined targets. We built several minimal protein libraries, screened them in vitro by phage display and analyzed their response to selection by high-throughput sequencing. A statistical analysis of the results reveals two main findings: first, libraries with same sequence diversity but built around different "frameworks" typically have vastly different responses, second, the distribution of responses within a library follows a simple scaling law. We show how an elementary probabilistic model based on extreme value theory rationalizes these findings. Our results have implications for designing synthetic protein libraries, for estimating the density of functional biomolecules in sequence space, for characterizing diversity in natural populations and for experimentally investigating the concept of evolvability, or potential for future evolution.},

abstract = {High-throughput sequencing (HTS) of antibody repertoire libraries has become a powerful tool in the field of systems immunology. However, numerous sources of bias in HTS workflows may affect the obtained antibody repertoire data. A crucial step in antibody library preparation is the addition of short platform-specific nucleotide adapter sequences. As of yet, the impact of the method of adapter addition on experimental library preparation and the resulting antibody repertoire HTS datasets has not been thoroughly investigated. Therefore, we compared three standard library preparation methods by performing Illumina HTS on antibody variable heavy genes from murine antibody-secreting cells. Clonal overlap and rank statistics demonstrated that the investigated methods produced equivalent HTS datasets. PCR-based methods were experimentally superior to ligation with respect to speed, efficiency, and practicality. Finally, using a two-step PCR based method we established a protocol for antibody repertoire library generation, beginning from inputs as low as 1 ng of total RNA. In summary, this study represents a major advance towards a standardized experimental framework for antibody HTS, thus opening up the potential for systems-based, cross-experiment meta-analyses of antibody repertoires.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical presentation and medical treatment of patients with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) during first year of illness. Our study focused on three-year outcomes in a longitudinally followed sub-cohort. METHODS: From 2000 to 2013, 597 sJIA patients with disease duration of ≤12 months were recorded in the National Pediatric Rheumatologic Database (NPRD). Among those, three-year outcome data were available for 133 patients. This included the clinical Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Score (cJADAS-10) and the physicians' global assessment score, as well as assessment of joint involvement, growth retardation and patient-reported outcomes. RESULTS: The median cJADAS-10 significantly declined from seven in 2000 to two in 2013, while the proportion of patients with inactive disease increased from 19{\%} in 2000 to 41{\%} in 2013. Treatment with systemic glucocorticoids and disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) remained stable over the period. In 2013, the proportion of patients treated with biological DMARDs increased to 20{\%} of sJIA patients. Three years post onset, 72{\%} of sJIA patients achieved inactive disease and 75{\%} had no functional limitations. Growth retardation was associated with persistently high disease activity and continuing use of systemic glucocorticoids. At the three-year follow-up, one-third of patients were still being treated with systemic glucocorticoids. CONCLUSION: The proportion of patients achieving inactive disease has increased over the last decade. Possible explanations may include improved access to specialized care, additional treatment options, and earlier or faster step-up treatment. However, challenges in sJIA management remain, as approximately 30{\%} of patients continue to present with ongoing, active disease. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

Across the board, these precursor populations were phenotypically naive and occurred with hierarchical frequencies clustered by Ag specificity. The corresponding patterns of TCR architecture were highly ordered and displayed partial overlap with adult memory, indicating biased structuring of the T-cell repertoire during Ag-driven selection.

A variety of experimental techniques have been employed to quantify the relative contributions of these processes. In modern studies lymphocytes are typically labeled with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU), deuterium, or the fluorescent dye carboxy-fluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE), their division history has been studied by monitoring telomere shortening and the dilution of T cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) or the dye CFSE, and clonal expansion has been documented by recording changes in the population densities of antigen specific cells. Proper interpretation of such data in terms of the underlying rates of T cell production, division, and death has proven to be notoriously difficult and involves mathematical modeling. We review the various models that have been developed for each of these techniques, discuss which models seem most appropriate for what type of data, reveal open problems that require better models, and pinpoint how the assumptions underlying a mathematical model may influence the interpretation of data. Elaborating various successful cases where modeling has delivered new insights in T cell population dynamics, this review provides quantitative estimates of several processes involved in the maintenance of naive and memory, CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell pools in mice and men.},

To measure the impact of N-region diversity on public repertoires, we have characterized the alphabeta TCRs specific for several CD4 or CD8 epitopes of wild-type mice and of mice deficient in the enzyme TdT. We find that V, (D), J usage identified in public repertoires is strikingly conserved in TdT(o/o) mice, even for the CDR3 loops which are shorter than those found in TdT(+/+) animals. Moreover, the 10- to 20-fold decrease in alphabeta T cell diversity in TdT(o/o) mice did not prevent T cells from undergoing affinity maturation during secondary responses. A comparison of the CDR3beta in published public and private repertoires indicates significantly reduced N-region diversity in public CDR3beta. We interpret our findings as suggesting that public repertoires are produced more efficiently than private ones by the recombination machinery. Alternatively, selection may be biased in favor of public repertoires in the context of the interactions between TCR and MHC peptide complexes and we hypothesize that MHCalpha helices are involved in the selection of public repertoires.},

We derive a mathematical relation between the abundance distribution and the R$\backslash$'enyi entropy, by analogy with the equivalence of ensembles in thermodynamics. The abundance distribution is mapped onto the density of states, and the R$\backslash$'enyi entropy to the free energy. The two quantities are related in the thermodynamic limit by a Legendre transform, by virtue of the equivalence between the micro-canonical and canonical ensembles. In this limit, we show how the R$\backslash$'enyi entropy can be constructed geometrically from rank-frequency plots. This mapping predicts that non-concave regions of the rank-frequency curve should result in kinks in the R$\backslash$'enyi entropy as a function of its order. We illustrate our results on simple examples, and emphasize the limitations of the equivalence of ensembles when a thermodynamic limit is not well defined. Our results help choose reliable diversity measures based on the experimental accuracy of the abundance distributions in particular frequency ranges.},

abstract = {Adaptive immune recognition is mediated by antigen receptors on B and T cells generated by somatic recombination during lineage development. The high level of diversity resulting from this process posed technical limitations that previously limited the comprehensive analysis of adaptive immune recognition. Advances over the last ten years have produced data and approaches allowing insights into how T cells develop, evolutionary signatures of recombination and selection, and the features of T cell receptors that mediate epitope-specific binding and T cell activation. The size and complexity of these data have necessitated the generation of novel computational and analytical approaches, which are transforming how T cell immunology is conducted. Here we review the development and application of novel biological, theoretical, and computational methods for understanding T cell recognition and discuss the potential for improved models of receptor:antigen interactions.},

However, we found several clonotypes in memory T cell fraction that were undetectable before the vaccination and had a maximum concentration at day 45 after vaccine administration. These cells were found in lower concentration in the course of repertoire monitoring for two years period.

abstract = {A straightforward argument is presented to calculate the number of different major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules in an individual that maximizes the probability of mounting immune responses against a large number of foreign peptides. It is assumed that increasing the number of MHC molecules per individual, n, has three different effects: (i) it increases the number of foreign peptides that can be presented; (ii) it increases the number of different T-cell receptors (TCRs) positively selected in the thymus; but (iii) it reduces the number of TCRs by negative selection. The mathematical analysis shows that n = 1/f maximizes the number of different TCRs that pass through positive and negative selection and that n = 2/f maximizes the probability to mount immune responses against a large fraction of foreign peptides. Here f is the fraction of TCRs deleted by one MHC molecule. Both results depend on approximations that are discussed in the paper. The model presented has implications for our understanding of the evolutionary forces acting on the MHC.},

We explore associations between MHC alleles, immune exposures, and shared TCRs in a large human cohort. Using a previously published repertoire sequencing dataset augmented with high-resolution MHC genotyping, our analysis reveals rich structure: striking imprints of common pathogens, clusters of co-occurring TCRs that may represent markers of shared immune exposures, and substantial variations in TCR-MHC association strength across MHC loci. Guided by atomic contacts in solved TCR:peptide-MHC structures, we identify sequence covariation between TCR and MHC. These insights and our analysis framework lay the groundwork for further explorations into TCR diversity.},

Despite its importance, quantifying selection in experimentally derived sequences is fraught with difficulties. The necessary parameters for statistical tests (such as the expected frequency of replacement mutations in the absence of selection) are non-trivial to calculate, and results are not easily interpretable when analyzing more than a handful of sequences. We have developed a web server that implements our previously proposed Focused binomial test for detecting selection. Several features are integrated into the web site in order to facilitate analysis, including V(D)J germline segment identification with IMGT alignment, batch submission of sequences and integration of additional test statistics proposed by other groups. We also implement a Z-score-based statistic that increases the power of detecting selection while maintaining specificity, and further allows for the combined analysis of sequences from different germlines.

abstract = {Natural variability in the abundance of signaling regulators can lead to divergence in cell fate, even within genetically identical cells that share a common differentiation state. We introduce cell-to-cell variability analysis (CCVA), an experimental and computational methodology that quantifies the correlation between variability in signaling regulator abundance and variation in the sensitivity of cells to stimuli. With CCVA, we investigated the unexpected effects of the interleukin 2 (IL-2) receptor $\alpha$ chain (IL-2R$\alpha$) on the sensitivity of primary mouse T lymphocytes to cytokines that signal through receptors that have the common $\gamma$ chain ($\gamma$(c)). Our work showed that increased IL-2R$\alpha$ abundance decreased the concentration of IL-2 required for a half-maximal activation (EC(50)) of the downstream effector signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5), but reduced the responsiveness to IL-7 or IL-15, without affecting the EC(50) values of other $\gamma$(c) cytokines. To investigate the mechanism of the effect of IL-2R$\alpha$ on $\gamma$(c) cytokine signaling, we introduced a Bayesian-inference computational framework that models the formation of receptor signaling complexes with data from previous biophysical measurements. With this framework, we found that a model in which IL-2R$\alpha$ drives $\gamma$(c) depletion through the assembly of functional IL-2R complexes was consistent with both the CCVA data and experimental measurements. The combination of CCVA and computational modeling produced quantitative understanding of the crosstalk between $\gamma$(c) cytokine receptor signaling in T lymphocytes.},

abstract = {A detailed characterization of the dynamics and breadth of the immune response to an acute viral infection, as well as the determinants of recruitment to immunological memory, can greatly contribute to our basic understanding of the mechanics of the human immune system, and can ultimately guide the design of effective vaccines. In addition to neutralizing antibodies, T cells have been shown to be critical for the effective resolution of acute viral infections. We report the first in-depth analysis of the dynamics of the CD8(+) T cell repertoire at the level of individual T cell clonal lineages upon vaccination of human volunteers with a single dose of YF-17D. This live attenuated yellow fever vaccine yields sterile, long-term immunity and has been previously used as a model to understand the immune response to a controlled acute viral infection. We identified and enumerated unique CD8(+) T cell clones specifically induced by this vaccine through a combined experimental and statistical approach that includes high throughput sequencing of the CDR3 variable region of the T cell receptor $\beta$ chain and an algorithm that detects significantly expanded T cell clones. This allowed us to establish that: (a) on average ∼2,000 CD8(+) T cell clones were induced by YF-17D, (b) 5-6{\%} of the responding clones were recruited to long-term memory three months post-vaccination, (c) the most highly-expanded effector clones were preferentially recruited to the memory compartment, and (d) a fraction of the YF-17D-induced clones can be identified from peripheral blood lymphocytes solely by measuring clonal expansion.

IMPORTANCE: The exhaustive investigation of pathogen-induced effector T cells is essential to accurately quantify the dynamics of the human immune response. The yellow fever vaccine (YFV) has been broadly used as a model to understand how a controlled, self-resolving acute viral infection induces an effective and long-term protective immune response. Here, we extend this previous work by reporting the identity of activated effector T cell clones that expand in response to the YFV two weeks post-vaccination (as defined by their unique T-cell receptor gene sequence), and by tracking clones that enter the memory compartment 6 weeks later. This is the first study to use high-throughput sequencing of immune cells to characterize the breadth of the anti-viral effector cell response, and to determine the contribution of unique virus-induced clones to the long-lived memory T cell repertoire. Thus, it establishes a benchmark against which future vaccines can be compared to predict their efficacy.},

Finally, we identified three potential immunogenic somatic mutations on the basis of their co-occurrence with CDR3 sequences.

abstract = {Public responses where identical T cell receptors (TCRs) are clonally dominant and shared between different individuals are a common characteristic of CD8(+) T cell-mediated immunity. Focusing on TCR sharing, we analyzed approximately 3,400 TCR beta chains (TCRbetas) from mouse CD8(+) T cells responding to the influenza A virus D(b)NP(366) and D(b)PA(224) epitopes. Both the "public" D(b)NP(366)-specific and "private" D(b)PA(224)-specific TCR repertoires contain a high proportion ( approximately 36{\%}) of shared TCRbetas, although the numbers of mice sharing TCRbetas in each repertoire varies greatly. Sharing of both the TCRbeta amino acid and TCRbeta nucleotide sequence was negatively correlated with the prevalence of random nucleotide additions in the sequence. However, the extent of TCRbeta amino acid sequence sharing among mice was strongly correlated with the level of diversity in the encoding nucleotide sequences, suggesting that a key feature of public TCRs is that they can be made in a variety of ways. Using a computer simulation of random V(D)J recombination, we estimated the relative production frequencies and variety of production mechanisms for TCRbeta sequences and found strong correlations with the sharing of both TCRbeta amino acid sequences and TCRbeta nucleotide sequences. The overall conclusion is that "convergent recombination," rather than a bias in recombination or subsequent selection, provides the mechanistic basis for TCR sharing between individuals responding to identical peptide plus MHC class I glycoprotein complexes.},

abstract = {To recognize pathogens, B and T lymphocytes are endowed with a wide repertoire of receptors generated stochastically by V(D)J recombination. Measuring and estimating the diversity of these receptors is of great importance for understanding adaptive immunity. In this chapter we review recent modeling approaches for analyzing receptor diversity from high-throughput sequencing data. We first clarify the various existing notions of diversity, with its many competing mathematical indices, and the different biological levels at which it can be evaluated. We then describe inference methods for characterizing the statistical diversity of receptors at different stages of their history: generation, selection and somatic evolution. We discuss the intrinsic difficulty of estimating the diversity of receptors realized in a given individual from incomplete samples. Finally, we emphasize the limitations of diversity defined at the level of receptor sequences, and advocate the more relevant notion of functional diversity relative to the set of recognized antigens.},

The model follows the dynamics of a viral infection and the stimulation, proliferation, and differentiation of na{\"{i}}ve CD8+T cells into effector CTL, which can eliminate virally infected cells. The model is capable of following the dynamics of multiple T cell clones, each with a T cell receptor represented by a digit string. MHC-viral peptide complexes are also represented by strings and a string match rule is used to compute the affinity of a T cell receptor for a viral epitope. The avidities of interactions are also computed by taking into consideration the density of MHC-viral peptides on the surface of an infected cell. Lastly, the model allows the probability of T cell stimulation to depend on avidity but also incorporates the notion of an antigen-independent programmed proliferative response. We compare the model to experimental data on the cytotoxic T cell response to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infections. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In order to recognize and combat a diverse array of pathogens the immune system has a large repertoire of T cells having unique T cell receptors (TCRs) with only a few clones specific for any given antigen. We discuss how the number of different possible TCRs encoded in the genome (the potential repertoire) and the number of different TCRs present in an individual (the realized repertoire) can be measured. One puzzle is that the potential repertoire greatly exceeds the realized diversity of na{\"{i}}ve T cells within any individual. We show that the existing hypotheses fail to explain why the immune system has the potential to generate far more diversity than is used in an individual, and propose an alternative hypothesis of "evolutionary sloppiness." Another immunological puzzle is why mice and humans have similar repertoires even though humans have over 1000-fold more T cells. We discuss how the idea of the "protecton," the smallest unit of protection, might explain this discrepancy and estimate the size of "protecton" based on available precursor frequencies data. We then consider T cell cross-reactivity - the ability of a T cell clone to respond to more than one epitope. We extend existing calculations to estimate the extent of expected cross-reactivity between the responses to different pathogens. Our results are consistent with two observations: a low probability of observing cross-reactivity between the immune responses to two randomly chosen pathogens; and the ensemble of memory cells being sufficiently diverse to generate cross-reactive responses to new pathogens.},

abstract = {The human immune system depends on a highly diverse collection of antibody-making B cells. B cell receptor sequence diversity is generated by a random recombination process called "rearrangement" forming progenitor B cells, then a Darwinian process of lineage diversification and selection called "affinity maturation." The resulting receptors can be sequenced in high throughput for research and diagnostics. Such a collection of sequences contains a mixture of various lineages, each of which may be quite numerous, or may consist of only a single member. As a step to understanding the process and result of this diversification, one may wish to reconstruct lineage membership, i.e. to cluster sampled sequences according to which came from the same rearrangement events. We call this clustering problem "clonal family inference." In this paper we describe and validate a likelihood-based framework for clonal family inference based on a multi-hidden Markov Model (multi-HMM) framework for B cell receptor sequences. We describe an agglomerative algorithm to find a maximum likelihood clustering, two approximate algorithms with various trade-offs of speed versus accuracy, and a third, fast algorithm for finding specific lineages. We show that under simulation these algorithms greatly improve upon existing clonal family inference methods, and that they also give significantly different clusters than previous methods when applied to two real data sets.},

Statistical analysis of repertoire sequencing data has the potential to decode disease associations from large cohorts with measured phenotypes.

We explore associations between MHC alleles, immune exposures, and shared TCRs in a large human cohort. Using a previously published repertoire sequencing dataset augmented with high-resolution MHC genotyping, our analysis reveals rich structure: striking imprints of common pathogens, clusters of co-occurring TCRs that may represent markers of shared immune exposures, and substantial variations in TCR-MHC association strength across MHC loci. Guided by atomic contacts in solved TCR:peptide-MHC structures, we identify sequence covariation between TCR and MHC. These insights and our analysis framework lay the groundwork for further explorations into TCR diversity.},

abstract = {The T cell receptor (TCR) orchestrates immune responses by binding to foreign peptides presented at the cell surface in the context of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. Effective immunity requires that all possible foreign peptide-MHC molecules are recognized or risks leaving holes in immune coverage that pathogens could quickly evolve to exploit. It is unclear how a limited pool of {\textless}108 human TCRs can successfully provide immunity to the vast array of possible different peptides that could be produced from 20 proteogenic amino acids and presented by self-MHC molecules ({\textgreater}1015 distinct peptide-MHCs). One possibility is that T cell immunity incorporates an extremely high level of receptor degeneracy, enabling each TCR to recognize multiple peptides. However, the extent of such TCR degeneracy has never been fully quantified. Here, we perform a comprehensive experimental and mathematical analysis to reveal that a single patient-derived autoimmune CD8+ T cell clone of pathogenic relevance in human type I diabetes recognizes {\textgreater}one million distinct decamer peptides in the context of a single MHC class I molecule. A large number of peptides that acted as substantially better agonists than the wild-type “index” preproinsulin-derived peptide (ALWGPDPAAA) were identified. The RQFGPDFPTI peptide (sampled from {\textgreater}108 peptides) was {\textgreater}100-fold more potent than the index peptide despite differing from this sequence at 7 of 10 positions. Quantification of this previously unappreciated high level of CD8+ T cell cross-reactivity represents an important step toward understanding the system requirements for adaptive immunity and highlights the enormous potential of TCR degeneracy to be the causative factor in autoimmune disease.},

Four TIL-derived TCRs exhibited strong selection for peptides presented in a highly diverse pHLA-A∗02:01 library. Three of the TIL TCRs were specific for non-mutated self-antigens, two of which were present in separate patient tumors, and shared specificity for a non-mutated self-antigen derived from U2AF2. These results show that the exposed recognition surface of MHC-bound peptides accessible to the TCR contains sufficient structural information to enable the reconstruction of sequences of peptide targets for pathogenic TCRs of unknown specificity. This finding underscores the surprising specificity of TCRs for their cognate antigens and enables the facile indentification of tumor antigens through unbiased screening. A new approach for identifying T cell receptor ligands reveals insights into the specificity of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes.},

abstract = {The decrease of TCR diversity with aging has never been studied by direct methods. In this study, we combined high-throughput Illumina sequencing with unique cDNA molecular identifier technology to achieve deep and precisely normalized profiling of TCR $\beta$ repertoires in 39 healthy donors aged 6-90 y. We demonstrate that TCR $\beta$ diversity per 10(6) T cells decreases roughly linearly with age, with significant reduction already apparent by age 40. The percentage of naive T cells showed a strong correlation with measured TCR diversity and decreased linearly up to age 70. Remarkably, the oldest group (average age 82 y) was characterized by a higher percentage of naive CD4(+) T cells, lower abundance of expanded clones, and increased TCR diversity compared with the previous age group (average age 62 y), suggesting the influence of age selection and association of these three related parameters with longevity. Interestingly, cross-analysis of individual TCR $\beta$ repertoires revealed a set {\textgreater}10,000 of the most representative public TCR $\beta$ clonotypes, whose abundance among the top 100,000 clones correlated with TCR diversity and decreased with aging.},

abstract = {Massively parallel sequencing is a useful approach for characterizing T-cell receptor diversity. However, immune receptors are extraordinarily difficult sequencing targets because any given receptor variant may be present in very low abundance and may differ legitimately by only a single nucleotide. We show that the sensitivity of sequence-based repertoire profiling is limited by both sequencing depth and sequencing accuracy. At two timepoints, 1 wk apart, we isolated bulk PBMC plus na{\"{i}}ve (CD45RA+/CD45RO-) and memory (CD45RA-/CD45RO+) T-cell subsets from a healthy donor. From T-cell receptor beta chain (TCRB) mRNA we constructed and sequenced multiple libraries to obtain a total of 1.7 billion paired sequence reads. The sequencing error rate was determined empirically and used to inform a high stringency data filtering procedure. The error filtered data yielded 1,061,522 distinct TCRB nucleotide sequences from this subject which establishes a new, directly measured, lower limit on individual T-cell repertoire size and provides a useful reference set of sequences for repertoire analysis. TCRB nucleotide sequences obtained from two additional donors were compared to those from the first donor and revealed limited sharing (up to 1.1{\%}) of nucleotide sequences among donors, but substantially higher sharing (up to 14.2{\%}) of inferred amino acid sequences. For each donor, shared amino acid sequences were encoded by a much larger diversity of nucleotide sequences than were unshared amino acid sequences. We also observed a highly statistically significant association between numbers of shared sequences and shared HLA class I alleles.},

Flow focusing is used to encapsulate single cells in emulsions containing magnetic beads for mRNA capture. The mRNA transcripts are then reverse-transcribed, physically linked to their partners by overlap extension PCR, and interrogated by high-throughput paired-end Illumina sequencing. This protocol describes the construction and operation of the flow-focusing device in detail, as well as the bioinformatics pipeline used to interpret the data. The entire procedure can be performed by a single researcher in under 12 h of effort per sample.},

Recently, Ising/Potts models,$\backslash$nalso known as Markov random fields, have been productively$\backslash$napplied to diverse problems in biology, including the prediction$\backslash$nof structural contacts from protein sequence data and the$\backslash$ndescription of neural activity patterns. However, inference of$\backslash$nsuch models is a challenging computational problem that cannot be$\backslash$nsolved exactly. Here, we describe the adaptive cluster expansion$\backslash$n(ACE) method to quickly and accurately infer Ising or Potts$\backslash$nmodels based on correlation data. ACE avoids overfitting by$\backslash$nconstructing a sparse network of interactions sufficient to$\backslash$nreproduce the observed correlation data within the statistical$\backslash$nerror expected due to finite sampling. When convergence of the$\backslash$nACE algorithm is slow, we combine it with a Boltzmann Machine$\backslash$nLearning algorithm (BML). We illustrate this method on a variety$\backslash$nof biological and artificial datasets and compare it to$\backslash$nstate-of-the-art approximate methods such as Gaussian and$\backslash$npseudo-likelihood inference.

abstract = {It is thought that the adaptive immune system of immature organisms follows a more deterministic program of antibody creation than is found in adults. We used high-throughput sequencing to characterize the diversifying antibody repertoire in zebrafish over five developmental time points. We found that the immune system begins in a highly stereotyped state with preferential use of a small number of V (variable) D (diverse) J (joining) gene segment combinations, but that this stereotypy decreases dramatically as the zebrafish mature, with many of the top VDJ combinations observed in 2-wk-old zebrafish virtually disappearing by 1 mo. However, we discovered that, in the primary repertoire, there are strong correlations in VDJ use that increase with zebrafish maturity, suggesting that VDJ recombination involves a level of deterministic programming that is unexpected. This stereotypy is masked by the complex diversification processes of antibody maturation; the variation and lack of correlation in full repertoires between individuals appears to be derived from randomness in clonal expansion during the affinity maturation process. These data provide a window into the mechanisms of VDJ recombination and diversity creation and allow us to better understand how the adaptive immune system achieves diversity.},

abstract = {T cells play fundamental roles in adaptive immunity, relying on a diverse repertoire of T-cell receptor (TCR) $\alpha$ and $\beta$ chains. Diversity of the TCR $\beta$ chain is generated in part by a random yet intrinsically biased combinatorial rearrangement of variable (V$\beta$), diversity (D$\beta$), and joining (J$\beta$) gene segments. The mechanisms that determine biases in gene segment use remain unclear. Here we show, using a high-throughput TCR sequencing approach, that a physical model of chromatin conformation at the DJ$\beta$ genomic locus explains more than 80{\%} of the biases in J$\beta$ use that we measured in murine T cells. This model also predicts correctly how differences in intersegment genomic distances between humans and mice translate into differences in J$\beta$ bias between TCR repertoires of these two species. As a consequence of these structural and other biases, TCR sequences are produced with different a priori frequencies, thus affecting their probability of becoming public TCRs that are shared among individuals. Surprisingly, we find that many more TCR sequences are shared among all five mice we studied than among only subgroups of three or four mice. We derive a necessary mathematical condition explaining this finding, which indicates that the TCR repertoire contains a core set of receptor sequences that are highly abundant among individuals, if their a priori probability of being produced by the recombination process is higher than a defined threshold. Our results provide evidence for an expanded role of chromatin conformation in VDJ rearrangement, from control of gene accessibility to precise determination of gene segment use.},

abstract = {T and B cell receptor repertoires are diversified by variable region gene rearrangement and selected based on functionality and lack of self-reactivity. Repertoires can also be defined based on phenotype and function rather than receptor specificity - such as the diversity of T helper cell subsets. Natural killer (NK) cell repertoires, in which each cell expresses a randomly chosen subset of its inhibitory receptor genes, and is educated based on self-MHC recognition by yet unknown mechanisms, are also phenotypic repertoires. Studying the generation, development and selection of lymphocyte repertoires, and their functions during immune responses, is essential for understanding the function of the immune system in healthy individuals and in immune deficient, autoimmune or cancer patients. The study of lymphocyte repertoires will enable clinical immunologists to develop better therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, vaccines, transplantation donor-recipient matching protocols, and other immune intervention strategies. The recent development of high-throughput methods for repertoire data collection - from multicolor flow cytometry through single-cell imaging to deep sequencing - presents us now, for the first time, with the ability to analyze and compare large samples of lymphocyte repertoires in health, aging and disease. The exponential growth of these datasets, however, challenges the theoretical immunology community to develop methods for data organization and analysis. Furthermore, the need to test hypotheses regarding immune function, and generate predictions regarding the outcomes of medical interventions, necessitates the development of complex mathematical and computational models, covering processes on multiple scales, from the genetic and molecular to the cellular and system scales.},

To identify patterns that could be used for sequence-based monitoring of the antibody response to dengue, we examined antibody heavy-chain gene rearrangements in longitudinal peripheral blood samples from 60 dengue patients. Comparing signatures between acute dengue, postrecovery, and healthy samples, we found increased expansion of B cell clones in acute dengue patients, with higher overall clonality in secondary infection. Additionally, we observed consistent antibody sequence features in acute dengue in the highly variable major antigen-binding determinant, complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3), with specific CDR3 sequences highly enriched in acute samples compared to postrecovery, healthy, or non-dengue samples. Dengue thus provides a striking example of a human viral infection where convergent immune signatures can be identified in multiple individuals.

Among the major MHC class I loci, HLA-B is the swiftest evolving and the most polymorphic locus. Additionally, responses restricted by HLA-B molecules tend to be dominant, and most associations with susceptibility or protection against infectious diseases have been assigned to HLA-B alleles. To assess whether the differences in responses mediated via two major HLA class I loci, HLA-B and HLA-A, may already begin at the Ag presentation level, we have analyzed the diversity and binding affinity of their peptide repertoire by making use of curated pathogen-derived epitope data retrieved from the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource, as well as in silico predicted epitopes. In contrast to our expectations, HLA-B alleles were found to have a less diverse peptide repertoire, which points toward a more restricted binding motif, and the respective average peptide binding affinity was shown to be lower than that of HLA-A-restricted epitopes. This unexpected observation gives rise to new hypotheses concerning the mechanisms underlying immunodominance of CD8(+) T cell responses.},

abstract = {The enormous genetic diversity and mutability of HIV has prevented effective control of this virus by natural immune responses or vaccination. Evolution of the circulating HIV population has thus occurred in response to diverse, ultimately ineffective, immune selection pressures that randomly change from host to host. We show that the interplay between the diversity of human immune responses and the ways that HIV mutates to evade them results in distinct sets of sequences defined by similar collectively coupled mutations. Scaling laws that relate these sets of sequences resemble those observed in linguistics and other branches of inquiry, and dynamics reminiscent of neural networks are observed. Like neural networks that store memories of past stimulation, the circulating HIV population stores memories of host-pathogen combat won by the virus. We describe an exactly solvable model that captures the main qualitative features of the sets of sequences and a simple mechanistic model for the origin of the observed scaling laws. Our results define collective mutational pathways used by HIV to evade human immune responses, which could guide vaccine design.},

abstract = {The adaptive immune system generates highly specific immune responses against invading pathogens and plays an important role in maintaining the balance with commensal microorganisms. It also harbors the ability to protect against cancer and to prevent future infections through the formation of memory, the underlying principle of vaccination strategies. However, uncontrolled or unwanted immune responses can lead to severe disease, eg, if lymphocytes attack the own body in autoimmune diseases, overreact to commen-sal microbes in inflammatory bowel diseases, or mount responses against harmless structures in allergies or celiac disease. Two types of lymphocytes, T cells and B cells, mediate adaptive immune responses. Both cell populations express specific receptors on their surface that mediates antigen recognition and cell activation. A key feature of lymphocytes is that all cells express a unique antigen receptor with defined specificity. Thus, each individual cell can recognize only one antigen, whereas the population can recognize virtually any antigenic structure. A better understanding of the diversity of the antigen-receptor repertoire at the level of the individual , as well as overlaps or similarities among repertoires of different individuals, could instruct the design of targeted prevention strategies or therapies to fight a wide range of diseases. The long-term benefit would lie, for example, in the development of testable predictions of the efficacy of immunogens that target defined lym-phocyte subsets expressing antigen receptors with known protective capacity against invading pathogens. For the broad application of such approaches several prerequisites must be fulfilled. We need information on the precise nature of antigen receptors, of their interaction with their specific target epitopes, and of their effector function. We also need information on the frequency of lymphocytes expressing such receptors in the individual and at the population level. Through the use of next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies , we have gained unprecedented insights in the diversity of antigen receptor genes. 1 The challenge remains how to translate sequence information into predictions of antigen receptor function. Summary A hallmark of the adaptive immune system is the specificity of B cell and T cell responses. Mechanistically, this feature relies on the fact that the two genes that encode B cell and T cell antigen receptors are not germline encoded and instead are assembled from a large number of small gene segments during lymphocyte development. The underlying somatic gene recombination process can generate a quasi-unlimited repertoire of antigen receptors. The high degree of diversity is essential to guarantee recognition of nearly any antigenic structure to protect from the large variety of potential invading pathogens and to keep the balance with commensals. Due to the enormous complexity of the antigen receptor repertoire, our understanding of its actual size and functional convergence at the level of the individual and the population is still limited. A better understanding of the actual degree of diversity could help to predict adaptive immune responses and would have wide implications for the development of preventive and therapeutic measures against infectious and autoimmune diseases as well as cancer. Here, we discuss the recent advances in the field with a specific focus on B cells and the function of antibodies.

High-throughput sequencing can identify large numbers of heavy- and light-chain variable regions (V(H) and V(L)) in a given B-cell repertoire, but information about endogenous pairing of heavy and light chains is lost after bulk lysis of B-cell populations. Here we describe a way to retain this pairing information. In our approach, single B cells ({\textgreater}5 × 10(4) capacity per experiment) are deposited in a high-density microwell plate (125 pl/well) and lysed in situ. mRNA is then captured on magnetic beads, reverse transcribed and amplified by emulsion V(H):V(L) linkage PCR. The linked transcripts are analyzed by Illumina high-throughput sequencing. We validated the fidelity of V(H):V(L) pairs identified by this approach and used the method to sequence the repertoire of three human cell subsets-peripheral blood IgG(+) B cells, peripheral plasmablasts isolated after tetanus toxoid immunization and memory B cells isolated after seasonal influenza vaccination.},

These fetal sequences were compared with TCR beta chain rearrangements obtained from post-partum thymus, adult spleen, and adult peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Both fetal and adult TCR V beta 6 rearrangements exhibited a non-random usage of V beta and J beta elements. Up to 90{\%} of the sequences obtained at 11 weeks of gestation used J beta 2 elements, most notably J beta 2.1. In the 13 and 17 week old fetal and in the adult tissues, J beta 1 elements were used in approximately 30{\%} of the rearrangements while, within the J beta 2 rearrangements, J beta 2.1 and J beta 2.7 were used most frequently. Both fetal and adult TCR beta chain CDR3 regions showed non-random usage of amino acids. However, the early fetal repertoire was further limited due to the relative absence of N-regions in up to 60{\%} of the 11 and 13 week old TCR beta chain rearrangements, resulting in smaller antigen binding sites. In fetal and adult TCR beta chain rearrangements the distribution patterns of the length of N-regions and the usage profiles of J beta elements were similar in hematopoietic and peripheral organs, suggesting no apparent preference for particular TCR beta chain rearrangements.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

They recognize defective cells by binding to peptides presented on the cell surface by MHC class I molecules. Peptide binding to MHC molecules is the single most selective step in the Ag-presentation pathway. Therefore, in the quest for T cell epitopes, the prediction of peptide binding to MHC molecules has attracted widespread attention. In the past, predictors of peptide-MHC interactions have primarily been trained on binding affinity data. Recently, an increasing number of MHC-presented peptides identified by mass spectrometry have been reported containing information about peptide-processing steps in the presentation pathway and the length distribution of naturally presented peptides. In this article, we present NetMHCpan-4.0, a method trained on binding affinity and eluted ligand data leveraging the information from both data types. Large-scale benchmarking of the method demonstrates an increase in predictive performance compared with state-of-the-art methods when it comes to identification of naturally processed ligands, cancer neoantigens, and T cell epitopes.},

abstract = {Antibody repertoire diversity, potentially as high as 1011 unique molecules in a single individual, confounds characterization by conventional sequence analyses. In this study, we present a general method for assessing human antibody sequence diversity displayed on phage using massively parallel pyrosequencing, a novel application of Kabat column-labeled profile Hidden Markov Models, and translated complementarity determining region (CDR) capture-recapture analysis. Pyrosequencing of domain amplicon and RCA PCR products generated 1.5 × 106 reads, including more than 1.9 × 105 high quality, full-length sequences of antibody variable fragment (Fv) variable domains. Novel methods for germline and CDR classification and fine characterization of sequence diversity in the 6 CDRs are presented. Diverse germline contributions to the repertoire with random heavy and light chain pairing are observed. All germline families were found to be represented in 1.7 × 104 sequences obtained from repeated panning of the library. While the most variable CDR (CDR-H3) presents significant length and sequence variability, we find a substantial contribution to total diversity from somatically mutated germline encoded CDRs 1 and 2. Using a capture-recapture method, the total diversity of the antibody library obtained from a human donor Immunoglobulin M (IgM) pool was determined to be at least 3.5 × 1010. The results provide insights into the role of IgM diversification, display library construction, and productive germline usages in antibody libraries and the humoral repertoire.},

@article{Mayer2019,
abstract = {An essential feature of the adaptive immune system is the proliferation of antigen-specific lymphocytes during an immune reaction to form a large pool of effector cells. This proliferation must be regulated to ensure an effective response to infection while avoiding immunopathology. Recent experiments in mice have demonstrated that the expansion of a specific clone of T cells in response to cognate antigen obeys a striking inverse power law with respect to the initial number of T cells. Here, we show that such a relationship arises naturally from a model in which T cell expansion is limited by decaying levels of presented antigen. The same model also accounts for the observed dependence of T cell expansion on affinity for antigen and on the kinetics of antigen administration. Extending the model to address expansion of multiple T cell clones competing for antigen, we find that higher-affinity clones can suppress the proliferation of lower-affinity clones, thereby promoting the specificity of the response. Using the model to derive optimal vaccination protocols, we find that exponentially increasing antigen doses can achieve a nearly optimized response. We thus conclude that the dynamics of presented antigen is a key regulator of both the size and specificity of the adaptive immune response.},

abstract = {The composition of the peripheral blood lymphocyte compartment underlies developmental changes during ontogeny. Recently, several new B cell populations have been characterized which were suggested to develop in an age-dependent manner. However, age-dependent reference values for distinct B cell populations have rarely been reported. Therefore, we have characterized developmental changes in peripheral B cell populations from infancy to adulthood in order to define age-dependent reference values. Using a flow cytometric approach we analysed the frequencies as well as the absolute counts of naive, switched and non-switched memory B cells, CD27-negative memory B cells, transitional B cells as well as CD21(low) CD38(low) B cells from neonates up to the age of 50 years. Most of the B cell subsets showed age-dependent developmental changes: while the peripheral B cell pool during infancy is characterized predominantly by transitional and naive B cells, the fraction of switched and non-switched memory B cells increases gradually with age. CD21(low) CD38(low) B cells as well as plasmablasts do not exhibit developmental changes. In summary, we could demonstrate particular changes in the peripheral blood B cell compartment during ontogeny. This study provides reference values of different B cell subpopulations offering comparability for studies addressing disturbed peripheral B cell development in immunodeficiency, autoimmunity or B cell reconstitution following cell-depleting therapies.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 American Aging AssociationApproximately 50{\%} of individuals aged 6–49 years in the United States are infected with cytomegalovirus (CMV), with seroprevalence increasing with age, reaching 85–90{\%} by 75–80 years according to Bate et al. (Clin Infect Dis 50 (11): 1439-1447, 2010) and Pawelec et al. (Curr Opin Immunol 24:507-511, 2012). Following primary infection, CMV establishes lifelong latency with periodic reactivation. Immunocompetent hosts experience largely asymptomatic infection, but CMV can cause serious illness in immunocompromised populations, such as transplant patients and the elderly. Control of CMV requires constant immune surveillance, and recent discoveries suggest this demand alters general features of the immune system in infected individuals. Here, we review recent advances in the understanding of the immune response to CMV and the role of CMV in immune aging and fitness, while highlighting the importance of potential confounding factors that influence CMV studies. Understanding how CMV contributes to shaping “baseline” immunity has important implications for a host's ability to mount effective responses to diverse infections and vaccination.},

abstract = {T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire data contain information about infections that could be used in disease diagnostics and vaccine development, but extracting that information remains a major challenge. Here we developed a statistical framework to detect TCR clone proliferation and contraction from longitudinal repertoire data. We applied this framework to data from three pairs of identical twins immunized with the yellow fever vaccine. We identified 500-1500 responding TCRs in each donor and validated them using three independent assays. While the responding TCRs were mostly private, albeit with higher overlap between twins, they could be well predicted using a classifier based on sequence similarity. Our method can also be applied to samples obtained post-infection, making it suitable for systematic discovery of new infection-specific TCRs in the clinic.},

We used high-throughput sequencing of the variable domain of the antibody heavy chain from 14 zebrafish to analyze VDJ usage and antibody sequence. Zebrafish were found to use between 50 and 86{\%} of all possible VDJ combinations and shared a similar frequency distribution, with some correlation of VDJ patterns between individuals. Zebrafish antibodies retained a few thousand unique heavy chains that also exhibited a shared frequency distribution. We found evidence of convergence, in which different individuals made the same antibody. This approach provides insight into the breadth of the expressed antibody repertoire and immunological diversity at the level of an individual organism.},

abstract = {Somatic mutations are not distributed randomly throughout Ab V region genes. A sequence-specific target bias is revealed by a defined hierarchy of mutability among di- and trinucleotide sequences located within Ig intronic DNA. Here we report that the di- and trinucleotide mutability preference pattern is shared by mouse intronic JH and Jkappa clusters and by human VH genes, suggesting that a common mutation mechanism exists for all Ig V genes of both species. Using di- and trinucleotide target preferences, we performed a comprehensive analysis of human and murine germline V genes to predict regional mutabilities. Heavy chain genes of both species exhibit indistinguishable patterns in which complementarity-determining region 1 (CDR1), CDR2, and framework region 3 (FR3) are predicted to be more mutable than FR1 and FR2. This prediction is borne out by empirical mutation data from nonproductively rearranged human VH genes. Analysis of light chain genes in both species also revealed a common, but unexpected, pattern in which FR2 is predicted to be highly mutable. While our analyses of nonfunctional Ig genes accurately predicts regional mutation preferences in VH genes, observed relative mutability differences between regions are more extreme than expected. This cannot be readily accounted for by nascent mRNA secondary structure or by a supplemental gene conversion mechanism that might favor nucleotide replacements in CDR. Collectively, our data support the concept of a common mutation mechanism for heavy and light chain genes of mice and humans with regional bias that is qualitatively, but not quantitatively, accounted for by short nucleotide sequence composition.},

abstract = {The T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire encodes immune exposure history through the dynamic formation of immunological memory. Statistical analysis of repertoire sequencing data has the potential to decode disease associations from large cohorts with measured phenotypes. However, the repertoire perturbation induced by a given immunological challenge is conditioned on genetic background via major histocompatibility complex (MHC) polymorphism. We explore associations between MHC alleles, immune exposures, and shared TCRs in a large human cohort. Using a previously published repertoire sequencing dataset augmented with high-resolution MHC genotyping, our analysis reveals rich structure: striking imprints of common pathogens, clusters of co-occurring TCRs that may represent markers of shared immune exposures, and substantial variations in TCR-MHC association strength across MHC loci. Guided by atomic contacts in solved TCR:peptide-MHC structures, we identify sequence covariation between TCR and MHC. These insights and our analysis framework lay the groundwork for further explorations into TCR diversity.},
