abstract = {To recognize pathogens, B and T lymphocytes are endowed with a wide repertoire of receptors generated stochastically by V(D)J recombination. Measuring and estimating the diversity of these receptors is of great importance for understanding adaptive immunity. In this chapter we review recent modeling approaches for analyzing receptor diversity from high-throughput sequencing data. We first clarify the various existing notions of diversity, with its many competing mathematical indices, and the different biological levels at which it can be evaluated. We then describe inference methods for characterizing the statistical diversity of receptors at different stages of their history: generation, selection and somatic evolution. We discuss the intrinsic difficulty of estimating the diversity of receptors realized in a given individual from incomplete samples. Finally, we emphasize the limitations of diversity defined at the level of receptor sequences, and advocate the more relevant notion of functional diversity relative to the set of recognized antigens.},

abstract = {The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is one of the most widely used techniques in molecular biology. In combination with High Throughput Sequencing (HTS), PCR is widely used to quantify transcript abundance for RNA-seq, and in the context of analysis of T and B cell receptor repertoires. In this study, we combine DNA barcoding with HTS to quantify PCR output from individual target molecules. We develop computational tools that simulate both the PCR branching process itself, and the subsequent subsampling which typically occurs during HTS sequencing. We explore the influence of different types of heterogeneity on sequencing output, and compare them to experimental results where the efficiency of amplification is measured by barcodes uniquely identifying each molecule of starting template. Our results demonstrate that the PCR process introduces substantial amplification heterogeneity, independent of primer sequence and bulk experimental conditions. This heterogeneity can be attributed both to inherited differences between different template DNA molecules, and the inherent stochasticity of the PCR process. The results demonstrate that PCR heterogeneity arises even when reaction and substrate conditions are kept as constant as possible, and therefore single molecule barcoding is essential in order to derive reproducible quantitative results from any protocol combining PCR with HTS.},

abstract = {T cells play a key role in the adaptive immune system. The broad repertoire of unique receptors expressed by T cells is in principle able to recognize a huge diversity of pathogens, but how to extract that information from blood samples remains unclear. By sequencing and analyzing the statistics of T cell receptors of subjects vaccinated against yellow fever, we identified vaccine-specific receptors that expanded following vaccination. We show that each individual has a unique response, which is similar yet across subjects in its sequence composition, with a slightly higher similarity between twins. Our method can be used in the clinic to track disease-specific T cell clones expanding or contracting after infection, vaccination, or therapy.T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire data contain information about infections that could be used in disease diagnostics and vaccine development, but extracting that information remains a major challenge. Here we developed a statistical framework to detect TCR clone proliferation and contraction from longitudinal repertoire data. We applied this framework to data from three pairs of identical twins immunized with the yellow fever vaccine. We identified 600 to 1,700 responding TCRs in each donor and validated them using three independent assays. While the responding TCRs were mostly private, albeit with higher overlap between twins, they could be well-predicted using a classifier based on sequence similarity. Our method can also be applied to samples obtained postinfection, making it suitable for systematic discovery of new infection-specific TCRs in the clinic.},

@article{Love2014,
abstract = {In comparative high-throughput sequencing assays, a fundamental task is the analysis of count data, such as read counts per gene in RNA-seq, for evidence of systematic changes across experimental conditions. Small replicate numbers, discreteness, large dynamic range and the presence of outliers require a suitable statistical approach. We present DESeq2, a method for differential analysis of count data, using shrinkage estimation for dispersions and fold changes to improve stability and interpretability of estimates. This enables a more quantitative analysis focused on the strength rather than the mere presence of differential expression. The DESeq2 package is available at http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html webcite.},
