abstract = {To recognize pathogens, B and T lymphocytes are endowed with a wide repertoire of receptors generated stochastically by V(D)J recombination. Measuring and estimating the diversity of these receptors is of great importance for understanding adaptive immunity. In this chapter we review recent modeling approaches for analyzing receptor diversity from high-throughput sequencing data. We first clarify the various existing notions of diversity, with its many competing mathematical indices, and the different biological levels at which it can be evaluated. We then describe inference methods for characterizing the statistical diversity of receptors at different stages of their history: generation, selection and somatic evolution. We discuss the intrinsic difficulty of estimating the diversity of receptors realized in a given individual from incomplete samples. Finally, we emphasize the limitations of diversity defined at the level of receptor sequences, and advocate the more relevant notion of functional diversity relative to the set of recognized antigens.},

abstract = {The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is one of the most widely used techniques in molecular biology. In combination with High Throughput Sequencing (HTS), PCR is widely used to quantify transcript abundance for RNA-seq, and in the context of analysis of T and B cell receptor repertoires. In this study, we combine DNA barcoding with HTS to quantify PCR output from individual target molecules. We develop computational tools that simulate both the PCR branching process itself, and the subsequent subsampling which typically occurs during HTS sequencing. We explore the influence of different types of heterogeneity on sequencing output, and compare them to experimental results where the efficiency of amplification is measured by barcodes uniquely identifying each molecule of starting template. Our results demonstrate that the PCR process introduces substantial amplification heterogeneity, independent of primer sequence and bulk experimental conditions. This heterogeneity can be attributed both to inherited differences between different template DNA molecules, and the inherent stochasticity of the PCR process. The results demonstrate that PCR heterogeneity arises even when reaction and substrate conditions are kept as constant as possible, and therefore single molecule barcoding is essential in order to derive reproducible quantitative results from any protocol combining PCR with HTS.},
